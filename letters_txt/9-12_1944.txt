My darling Annette,

This is the third time I write and rewrite this letter.  Your letter of August 22 stirred my feelings.  I am striving to find words that express my emotional turmoil and at the same time not hurt your feelings.

Lately, I have received your letters very regularly every two or three days.  They all gave me great pleasure and made me happy and proud of my wife.

Today, at ten o’clock I read your letter.  The first thing I looked at was the date stamped on the envelope.  It was August 23.  By then, I thought you had received the official notification that I was awarded the Silver Star.  I had sent it to you.  I had mailed it to you within an hour after I received it.  It was self-explanatory and I thought that it did not need any of my comments.  I was sure it would make you happy and a little proud.  A couple of weeks before, I had sent you $200. by telegraph.  The two put together, I thought, would make you happy.  I even surmised and fancied that they would have created in you a feeling of exaltation.  I was looking forward with a feeling of expectation and anxiety.  It was something I cherished and expected.  I had even dreamed about it.  I wanted a sweet letter as a reward.

I opened the letter.  The introductory “Dear” was like a shower of cold, icy water.  The detailed amount of the expenses you incurred to put the car on the road did not help any.  If I were home, I am sure we would have had one of those bitter arguments we used to have.

I would like to make it clear that I did not ask for a detailed account.  I wanted to know how much it cost to put the car in condition to run again.  I did not answer your inquiry concerning my opinion about it.  I thought it superfluous.  I trusted your good judgment and knew that you know more about its condition than I.  Moreover, I read between the lines that you wanted to drive it.  I had no objections.  I consider the hint that Mother would buy you a car whenever you desire was made with the intention to hurt.  I felt its sharp, painful sting.  It still hurts.

Let’s settle the question of the car.  When I came overseas, before I left, Dad had expressed the intention to buy a car.  He thought he could attend better to his business if he had a car at his disposition.  Moreover, then, his legs were making his life miserable.  I hinted to you the idea to give him the car.  I consider that it belonged to him.  He paid cash for my first car.  You remember the argument that ensued.  I dropped the subject and left it up to you.  I washed my hands of it with the intention and hope to stop any more arguments.  I did not tell you to store it, nor to use it.  You wanted it and I let you have it.  Meanwhile, Dad has changed his mind and moved to a new place.  His leg was hurting so badly that he was unable to attend to his work.  Now, he has no use of the car.  Is that settled?  I do not want to hear any more about it.  It’s in your hands.  I personally have forgotten about it and don’t care about it.

Now, let’s consider my desire to know how much money you spent.  I did not ask for a detailed account.  I expressed the desire to know how much it is or not to mention it.  I even told you that I don’t like indefinite statements.  Shall I from now on write to you about what you like to hear?  Do you want me to be sincere and write you what I think or shall I write only about my desire to come home?   Did you not write me time and time again to tell you what I thought?  Did you not remark in some of your letters that you wanted me to scold you if I did not agree with what you did?

Let’s close the incident and forget about it.  It doesn’t do any good to either of us.  Arguments don’t settle anything.  I learned that in the Army.  I ask you for a favor.  If you like to write some more letters similar to the one I just received, you may, but please do not mail them.  They hurt too much.

Lately, I have been writing often.  My life is running normally.  I have more time to myself now that my assistant is back.

I am sorry to disappoint you.  So far, they have not sent one medical officer home.  It’s a tragic fact.  I am so bitter about it that I am not able to express it in words.  Tell the politicians that as far as the medical officers are concerned, the rotation plan is a dirty political trick on the men who fight and suffer.  I don’t have any trust in any politician.  They will promise you the world now during election time.  They are not worthy of any consideration.  I’m bitter about the whole set-up and do not make any bones about hiding it.

I’m reading “Jane Eyre” by Charlotte Bronte.  I like the style.  It’s written in good English.  I’m disgusted and do not care for the English nobility.  They stink.  Thank God the American people got rid of them.

I saw “Ladies of Washington.”  I did not like it.  The acting was miserably poor.  

Within a few days, I’ll start my seventh month in the tropics.  The food is good and the weather is fine.  But who cares a darn for it?  I would prefer to be hungry and cold and be with you.  I reckon that New England is beautiful now.  I tried so hard and so persistently to get a trip home in October.  I keep hoping.  I’ll be home someday and will be very happy even if we have to argue occasionally.

I love you, darling.


											I am yours,

											Silvio

My darling and beloved wife,

Your two lovely letters of August 21 and 24 raised my morale sky high.  I wish I had them yesterday when I was perturbed and blue.  Today I’m sky high.  Within twenty-four hours, my morale has swung from a low to the highest point.  Now I feel grand.  I received the letters I was dreaming of receiving and read what I wanted to hear.

Do not worry about me.  I am living comfortably now.  I don’t have to exert myself unless I want to.  I pass most of my time reading books.  I have been reading many hours daily.  I have some satisfaction in taking care of my patients . I’m getting good results.

I do not need any cigarettes.  I don’t smoke much.  I get a pack a day and that is much more than I can use.  I used to smoke heavily during the campaign.

I have not received the Times yet.  I hope you subscribed to the Sunday Times overseas issue.

Do not renew my subscription to the Reader’s Digest.  I always receive it late and many times I don’t get it at all.  I can always find a copy at the Red Cross.

The watch you sent me became a casualty during the recent campaign.  The spring broke.  It refuses to run.  I have not asked you for a new one because I was told I could buy one at the canteen after the campaign was over.  That is what I did.  I bought one  with a luminous dial and numbers for $28.00.   I like it because I can see the hour without light in the middle of a dark night.  I don’t think you could buy a new 17-jewel watch for that money.  So far it runs well.  I was going to mention it, but always forgot.

I would like you to send me a toilet kit.  You know what I mean.  Do you remember the first Christmas gift you gave me?  I have been carrying it and using it for seven years.  I have cherished it and still do.  However, it’s getting old and useless.  The humidity of the tropics is corroding the leather.  I would like to send it back and keep it as a “memento.”
I would prefer one that is not bulky and has the essentials for washing and shaving.   In the Army we shave daily.  It is nearly a crime not to shave every day.

Do not compare me to Paul and Pepe.  They are base section commanders.  To us they are considered a little lower than the skunks.  They have been weeded out and considered unfit to defend their country.

You should not worry about the money.  I am not afraid to lose it.  It is not sent by mail.  You’ll receive it soon, I’m sure.

Some time ago, I sent you a box filled with clothes.  I would like to know if you received it.  It should be back by now.

I read “Jane Eyre.”  I finished it last night.  I enjoyed the first two hundred pages.  I became satiated of the long-winded and flourished conversations.  I do not know how a man or a girl can stand such long conversations.  She is an excellent writer and knows how to describe nature, homes, and clothing.  She is feminine through and through.

Today I started reading “H.M. Pulham, Esquire” by John Marquand.  The whole story develops around Boston.  Memories are coming back.  I just read where Harry passes through the Boston Common.  It just hints of it.  You and I were once at the Boston Common.  Do you remember?  

Tonight I’ll see a movie.  

I’m getting six bottles of beer a week.  I just got my ration.  I like a drink occasionally during the hottest part of the day.  I still get giddy if I drink more than a glass.  Don’t laugh at me!

Do not worry about me.  I’m still where I have been for three months and I’ll be here for quite a while longer.  I am well but for my yearning and craving to come home and my deeply felt bitterness not to have been selected yet to come home.

I love you with all my heart.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Another day is coming to a close.  These days are always the same, monotonous and pleasant.  I say monotonous because I am doing the same things every day.  Pleasant because I do not have any hardships and have a lot of time to myself.  

Don’t blame me if I do not write every day.  I know it’s selfish, but It’s the only pleasure I get out of life.  I read a great deal.  I become so interested in the story that I hate to leave it.  I’m sore at the bugler when he calls us to breakfast, dinner, or supper.  

The days are now pleasant, a little bit hotter than a month ago.  The hottest hour of the day is between ten and eleven in the morning.  The mornings are cool, pleasant like a June morning at home.  After eleven, a gentle breeze starts to blow.  As the day advances, it becomes stronger.  It is a nuisance then as far as I am concerned.  It keeps turning the pages of the book I am reading.  If I am not careful to use a weight or a bookmark, I lose my page when I am called away.

The nights are beautiful with a big moon.  The moonlight is so strong that I have been able to read a book written in large print.  If only you were here!

I want to tell you about a peculiar, strange sight unseen before in any other place.  There are a lot of fireflies.  They fly around most of the night.  But soon after sunset, they gather in great numbers on a tree near my tent.  They are in groups of hundreds and thousands.  The tree looks like a Christmas tree seen from a distance.  The fireflies keep on winking.  It’s a wonderful sight.  I wish I could describe it better.  I keep looking at them in wonder.  

I have not received any mail during the last few days.  Only one letter from Dad.  He also complains about the sluggish mail service.  I have been writing quite often.

										September 9, 1944

It was six o’clock when I wrote the word “often.”  Last night, I stopped writing and rushed to the radio station to hear the news broadcast.  The news are very encouraging and promising.  I hope it will crack soon.  I guess Germany will surrender by the end of the autumn or during the winter unless it decides to call it a day sooner.  By the time the news was over, it was dark and I had a new chance to admire the flickering lights of the fireflies.  

I am getting along as usual.  I only wish I could come home.   By the time you receive this letter, I’ll be in my 30th month overseas.  I am starting to wonder what the h--- I’m fighting for.  At the present, I am not getting even the minimum requirements for the pursuit of happiness.  It has been so far 29 months.  I did not mind at the beginning.  I knew it was my duty to fight for our freedoms.  I never hesitated, but now I’m fed up.  I feel I have done my duty.  I don’t ask for much: a trip home.  They don’t have any human feeling, nor any consideration for the desires and hopes of the men who fight.  Hence I wonder what I am fighting for.  I’ll only change my mind when I’ll be able to come home.


											I love you,

My darling Annette,

The war in Europe is coming to an end.  The news is very encouraging.  I expect it to end any time, at least before the end of the coming winter.  I feel that the war in Europe will be over during 1945 even if we do not get all the breaks.  I hope that as soon as the war in Europe comes to an end, they will give us a chance to go home.

I don’t blame you if your nerves are getting edgy.  I feel the same and have felt it for many months.  I don’t like to repeat myself, but my desire to come to you is becoming stronger and stronger.  I’m prepared to do anything possible within the limitations of the law.  How long can a man endure to live away from home?  What good is it to fight for home and family when one does not have a chance to visit them?  Is it life worth living to be away from one’s dear ones for so long?  I have more questions that I would like to spit out.  I had better quit.  

I do not have anything new.  I am in the same place under the same circumstances.  I don’t have to tell you how much I love you and that I have one hope, one desire, and yearning, to be back to you and love you and be happy with you.  I don’t have to tell you that you are the one and only girl in the whole world who can make me really and wholly happy.

I agree with you that I should write to you every day.  I don’t know what to say.  I don’t have anything new to say.  I only repeat myself.  I can only tell you what I feel, time and time again, that I love you.  I love you.

I still eat good food.  The pouring rain has brought a respite from the tropical heat of a couple of days ago.  We have summer here.  Within a few days, the sun will be straight on top of me at the noon hour.  The nights are enchanting.  I don’t sleep more than seven or eight hours.  The long nights from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. give me a lot of time to dream.  I don’t remember the past anymore.  I dream of the future: what we will do, where we’ll go, what I’ll tell you.  I live now in my fantasy of what I’ll experience when I come home.  I can’t tell you how many times I visualized our encounter and our intimate life afterwards.  Today I am hopeful.  I may be wrong, but I am full of hope.

I received a letter from Auntie.  I don’t blame her to be sore at me.  I forgot to answer her letter.  It’s true that I did not possess paper and time to answer then.  I know she is good to understand.

										I love you.

My darling Annette,

I have taken a long ride in a jeep.  This morning it rained for a quarter of an hour.  It rained enough to wet the road and keep the dust down to a minimum.  I road all around, by the blue ocean and along the beach.  It’s warm and it’s lovely, but I wish I were back in New England.  It’s lovely in New England now.  The lovely mornings, the cool nights.

You are worrying too much.  Now it does not call for it.  The mail is late sometimes.  Not all the letters go by plane.  Some go by boat.  These take a long time.  That’s the reason for the delay.  Sometimes, it’s physically impossible for me to write.

I’m getting along as usual.  I have the same desire, the same yearning.  I love you very much and hope to be with you soon.

I am reading a George Washington Carver biography and find it very interesting.  It seems that no prejudices or racial obstacles can stop the creation of a mind of genius.

I love you with all my heart.


									I am yours,

									Silvio

My darling Annette,

During the past few days, I have been moving.  Do not worry.  I’m still on the same island.  I have moved around.  I took a long voyage by boat.  It was a pleasant one.  The sea was as smooth as you dream of.  In peacetime, I would have called it a wonderful experience. 

I’m now located on the beach.  The sea at high tide is only four yards from my cot.  I fall asleep at night with the rhythmical, gentle splashing of the waves against the coral shore.  I have seen the most beautiful and enchanting sunsets in my whole life.  I wish I could describe to you the changing colors and hues and the effect of the sunlight upon the billowing clouds that always festoon the horizon where the sky and the sea meet.

My life is quiet.  I like this change.  A lot of native people come to visit us.  I am learning their language.  In a few days, I have already mastered a couple of hundred words.  The natives are very intelligent and full of fun.  The children come in groups.  They are very quick at learning English.  I was surprised to find so many children who know how to read and write.  Their penmanship is good.  They like our men.  Their playing, their garrulous voices, their screaming, and their laughing make me recall the school grounds of America during the intermission between classes.

Tomorrow I start my 30th month overseas.  I saw you the last time 29 months ago today.  It’s like a lifetime.  It seems as if a century has passed.  How long more?  I feel I have made enough sacrifices to deserve a rest and be considered a good citizen.  I feel I have done my part.  I know I deserve a trip home.  If I don’t get it, I’ll feel I am treated with injustice and abuse as if I were a slave, not a free citizen.

I am looking forward to coming home.  I hope they will not disappoint me.  I love you very much or to say it in the native tongue “Saja soeka nouja, saja poenja istri bagoes.”

I have not received your mail for some time.  I’m expecting some today.

									I love you.

My darling Annette,

Yesterday, I started my thirtieth month.  How many more?  How long will it last?

I have not received any letters of yours for more than a week.  The mail came in yesterday, but there was none for me.

Yesterday, I had another disappointment.  I lost my first Jap patient.  I had fought all night.  He was coming along fairly well when suddenly he refused to eat and died within a few hours.  I’m still wondering what he died from.  I treated him as a patient and tried my best to prolong his life, but to no avail.  Funny that I should have any feelings for an enemy who months ago did his utmost to destroy my life!  But I felt his loss.  He was to me another patient.  The hatred of war was dissipated.  The racial prejudice vanished.  He was my patient and as such was sacred.

I’m settling down.  The routine is not different. The presence of native children and men with their jabbering and laughing and playing gives a different background to my life.  The new and different always has a hold on me.

The weather has been cool lately considering the fact that now I am in the middle of the summer.  The sun does not make any shade at twelve o’clock.  It is right on top and hot.

I’m right in my tent, sitting at a rustic table on a box.  In front of me, the big, wide, calm ocean is silent.  The ripples are so small and hardly audible when they reach the coral shores.  This morning, I saw a school of porpoises swimming near the shore.  Some of them occasionally jumped into the air.  They appeared to have some fun as if they were children bounced into the air by strong arms.

Today, I have not practiced speaking the native language.  I am starting to make sense of the native jabbering.  I guess I could be able to talk like a native if I put my mind to it.
Just now these natives are here.  It’s now ten o’clock.  I told them to come back at twelve.  “Kamoes datang romari doeablas poakoel.”  They thanked me.  “Trisuna kasih.”  I can’t tell you why they have to come back at that time.

I am as usual waiting to be sent home.  I wish it would be tomorrow.  I hope and keep my fingers crossed.

I love you very much.  Oh!  How I wish I could kiss you!  How I yearn to be with you!  I’d be happy just to be with you.

										I love you.

My darling wife,

I am glad you enjoyed yourself during the Labor Day weekend.  I wish I were with you in New Hampshire.  You and I have to go there.  Next summer I hope.

Do not worry about me.  I’ll be here for a while.  Everything is peaceful.  The Japs don’t bother us.  They are so hungry that they have lost all their fighting spirit.

You were busy entertaining many friends.  It’s funny how things happened all at one time.  I know that the Navy takes good care of its men.  I’d better not talk about the Army.  It sure stinks.  I feel that I am not treated like a human being.  It’s a shame to keep a man overseas for 30 months!  When I came overseas, I knew what I was fighting for.  Now, I’m wondering what I am fighting for.

It looks as if Rose likes to hurt you.  I see a hint of sadism in her gossip.  There was nothing to talk or write about it.  I told you I met people.  I met many Aussies of both sexes.  Rose, however, has distorted the stories.  The girls I met at the club never found out that I was married because I told them that I was married and loved my wife.  They certainly did not want to have anything to do with me.  They were looking for husbands.  It’s better to say that they were hunting for husbands.  However, I met and made some friends.  I found out that honesty always pays.  I met good friends like the Taylors who always treated me like a friend.  There’s nothing to talk about it.  I always told you what was worth mentioning.  I was more interested in golf than the people I met.  I preferred those people who played better than I did so I could improve my game.  

I resent the implication that Paul made.  He should not include other people in his own exploits.  He thought I was a fool because I declared my marital status.  There is a girl in Australia who is very sore at him.  He promised her everything and got everything that he wanted.   When he was tired of her, he let her know that he was married.  I don’t think much of Paul as a man of principles.  He is selfish to the utmost.  He is always for Paul.  You got a hint of his character at Olympia when he was conniving to get the room we had.  Because he lives in adultery, he thinks that everybody else does.  Being a married man, nobody became interested in me, nor did I become interested in anybody.  The girls and men I met were always included in the mass of people that I always referred to you in my letters as people.  I never thought it necessary to write you if I saw a beautiful girl.  I never mind looking at a beautiful girl.  You know it.  I like them so much that I married one and I have never been sorry I married her, nor have I ever denied it to anybody as Paul is used to doing.

I have been fighting a war.  I have undergone all the hardships of training, all the gruesome experiences of battle.  I never had a private apartment, nor had any money to spend on champagne to entertain any Aussie.  Nobody becomes interested in a stingy married man.  The base section commander.  This is what men like Paul are called.  They are no good, they are the refuse, the men found unfit to defend their country.  Being no good, they can only find an outlet in depravity, liquor, and women.  You’ll excuse my outburst.  I’m sore at the d_____ b______.

I am still hoping to come home and waiting for my chance.  I deserve a share of happiness that has been denied to me so often and so long.

I love you and am all yours.

									September 28, 1944

My darling Annette,

The days are dragging on.  September is on the way out.  Another month gone.  I find solace in figuring out the time spent overseas.  

Time has an alluring appeal to me.  It’s always changing, always on the go, sometimes slowly, sometimes fast.  It’s movable, changeable, and unpredictable like the ocean.  It passes quickly or is eternal.  When I was in a foxhole in the dark of the night and danger and Japs were lurking all around, when I even held my breath, afraid to be heard, when the Japs were screaming and howling, when my legs were shaking and my back was experiencing a cold, tingling sensation, the time was eternal.  Dawn was never coming.  The minutes were longer than a week, the hours longer than years.

But the time I passed with you always passed quickly.  It ran away so quickly that I was only conscious of it when I sailed the ocean alone.  I would like to be back.  I would like to forget about time and live unconscious of its existence.  I have seen now 30 months dragging on.  Now the days are dragging on slowly and heavily.  

I am getting over the first cold I have had in 30 months.  I’m camped a few yards from the ocean.  The cold breeze of the long hours of the morning cooled my body and hence the cold.  It’s not bad, but it’s a cold.

The weather has been damp.  Last night it poured for hours.  When it rains, it really rains.  The rain is so heavy that it is not possible to see further than a hundred yards.  Once I took my clothes off and took a shower in the rain.  I had no trouble in rinsing myself.  I had difficulty in soaping myself.  The soap was washed away before it had a chance to dissolve the fats and dirt on my skin.  I was helpless.  I could not turn the knob of the running water.  It was worth the experience.

Have you read “Mrs. Parkington?”  You should.  I enjoyed it.  It’s one of the best books I have read since “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.”   “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” deals with the new Americans, the intruders.  “Mrs. Parkington” deals with the old stock, the descendants of the pioneers.  I’m certain that you would like it.  The style is fluent, the English is good.  It has a few dirty words here and there, used more for their pictorial and realistic descriptive value than for being vulgar.

As usual, I am getting along well.  I mean physically.  By the time you read these sheets, New England will be dressed in its best.  If only I could be able to ride with you along the countryside and for once live and be happy!  When will that be?  I hope soon.

I am wishing, I am hoping.  But I do hate and curse and curse when I consider the callousness of the people responsible for keeping me here for so long.

I love you, darling.  I love you very much.  I love you so much that it hurts.

										

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Considering all the expenses you had to meet, I don’t think you spent too much money on yourself.  You are quite changed from the girl I met seven years ago.  I mean apparently.  I felt then, however, though you tried to show me otherwise, that you knew how to take care about spending your money.  I know that I am lucky to have been married to a wonderful girl.  Our accounts disagree only slightly.  Here is how I see and found them.

You received as an allotment:

1942			180x8 months			$1440.
1943			180x10 months			$1800. 
			260x2 months			$  520.
1944			260x9					$2340.
I sent by mail or telegram					$1600.
I sent Mother and Dad					$  700.

I sent home a total of					$8400.

You sent Dad							$1160.

Considering all the expenses you had to meet, I think your expenses have been and are very low.  Maybe you would like to know my personal expenses since I came overseas.  I am going to disprove Rose’s contention that all the men overseas have a good time and spend money on the local girls.

I received during 1942 as pay				$2240.
I received during 1943 as pay				$4300.
I received up to Sept. 1, 1994 as pay			$3400. 

Total								$9940.
I sent you and Dad						$8400.

I spent a total in 29 months of				$1540.

Let me see how that money was spent.  I paid for my food and insurance of $28. a month.  $28. X 29 months = $812.  Take $812. from $1540. and you’ll get the amount I spent in 29 months overseas, $728.  That is an average of $25 a month.  With this money, I paid for clothing, shoes, golf, travel, cigarettes, movies at least twice a week and an occasional drink.  If Rose knows how a man can have a good time on a little over $5. a week from which sum all the above expenses are included, I would like to know.  The men who have a good time need a lot more money than that.  The fellows I know who had a good time, as Rose understands it, spent that amount alone during a leave of seven days in one of the big Australian cities.  Men who fight have to pay a higher price for enjoyment.  They don’t have the chance that Paul has with his private apartment and office girls to work with.

From the above cold statement, I know that you’ll agree with me that I never had a chance, nor the means, to entertain expensive ladies of pleasure, as Rose hinted to you.  Maybe I should have.  I get blamed anyhow.  As you see, darling, I have always thought and dreamed of you and lived thriftily, saving my income so as to spend it happily with you.  The above statement confirms my assertion beyond any question of doubt.  Do you agree with me, darling?  Don’t you think I have a good record?  

As I told you once, I don’t blame you for feeling that way.  It’s natural and it flatters and pleases me.  It is an evident and manifest sign and manifestation of the love you feel for me.  I have experienced the same feeling when I hear from the men fresh from home, talking about the good times the girls, married and single, have at home.  Because I know you, it does not take me long to feel at peace and forget feelings of jealousy.

I love you, darling.

									I am all yours

									Silvio




P.S.	I have been writing you at least 3 times a week.

My darling Annette,

You may be wondering and worrying because I have not written to you during the last few days.  A strong gale that blew violently for five long days and nights kept me isolated from outside communications.

I am on the same island.  I have been moving to different parts of it.  It’s lovely here at present.  The wind has subsided to a breeze and the temperature is moderate.  I am considering whether or not to go swimming.  There is a fresh water pool a couple of hundred yards from my cot.

By the way, the gale had made the sea so choppy and wavy that the breakers were coming to the doorsteps of my tent.  Some of the foaming water reached my cot.  The sea at high tide came to a yard from my tent.  I decided to move and I am far away from any danger of being swallowed by the waves or washed away by the violent breakers.

I am feeling well.  I pass my time reading.  I’m physically comfortable.  Spiritually, I am at my lowest.  My morale is so low that it has reached rock bottom.  I have been overseas for nearly 30 months.  I came overseas because I wanted to defend the rights of the common man.  Why should I fight now for the rights of the common man when those rights are denied to me?  Man does not live by bread alone.  The lousy politicians have been preaching it for centuries.  Why do they make me live by bread alone?  Who wants to be a beast in seclusion?

I’d better stop complaining.  However, I’ll never change my feeling until I’m treated like a human being and given a chance to see and love my dear ones.  I want to live and love and not vegetate. 

I miss you, darling.  I want and desire to be home with you more than anything else in the world.  I’m sorry to disappoint you again.  My birthday will come and go and I’ll still be here.  Don’t blame me, darling, but those who are responsible.

I love you and I always will.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I don’t know why, but today I feel a little better.  Maybe this bright, sunny, breezy day has slightly elevated my mood.  It does not mean that I am pleased.  I have not received any mail from you for a long time.  Your latest letter was written on September 5.  Somebody is slipping.  The mail service is getting sloppy again.  It makes me sore because I don’t see any excusable reason for the delay.

I feel like going down the hill to the river bank for a swim.  The water is cool, clear and only slightly salty.  I like to swim.  It’s the only thing that I actually enjoy, besides reading books.  Now I am reading “Kim” by Kipling.  Have you read it?  I appreciate it more now than I ever would have before.  I’m a little familiar now with the oriental minds and their superstitious beliefs.

I’m hoping to be sent home.  How long will I keep hoping?


										I love you.

My darling Annette,

You’ll be wondering why I haven’t written to you during the last week.  Do not worry.  I am not going into action.  I have been moving around within this island.  I have not left it, nor am I going to leave for a long while and when I do, I hope it is in the direction of San Francisco.

I have been moving around.  I mean it.  In fact, today I’m back where I was a month ago.  I consider my wanderings a vacation.  I had a chance to enjoy swimming and getting a first-class suntan.  

I had an occasion to observe the life of the native tribes.  I consider the native children the happiest in the whole world.  They enjoy summer twelve months a year and play and swim all year round.  The native adults don’t have to worry about clothing or housing.  They only need a patch of cloth and can build a good native hut in one afternoon.  The only worry they have is food.  They have plenty: a lot of coconuts and vegetables.  The ocean has an inexhaustible supply of fish.  

I took care of a few native patients.  I had one who was bitten by a poisonous snake.  I cut a deep gash in the skin where the fangs had left their unmistakable signs.  The native did not utter a word of complaint.  One day, they brought to me a man in a coma, that is he was unconscious.  He had not eaten for two weeks.  I took care of him even though he was hopeless and beyond any human or medical effort.  I never saw in all my life a man so skinny.  He was only skin and bones.

Yesterday, I received and read all the letters you wrote between September 5 and 26.  They all came in a bunch.  You can guess that I had a very pleasant afternoon.  I am glad you sent me your pictures.  I like them all, but particularly the one you took with Rose in front of the house.  I wanted to see you smiling.  Finally I got my wish.  In that picture, you are divinely charming.  It stirred all my emotions. 

Olson brought me, a few seconds ago, your birthday telegram.  You are always in time.  I am the one who is always late.  Thank you, darling.  I only hope that next year we will be able to celebrate it together.  

Going back to your pictures, you look wonderful.  You lost enough weight to regain the appearance you had seven years ago.  Oh, how I wish I could come home!  You’ll be sure to get a lot of loving when I come home.   I have been starving for thirty months and have stored a lot of reserves.  We have to make up for the time we lost.  I’ll love you twenty-four hours a day.  We will pick up our honeymoon where we left off.  Won’t we, darling?

Today I sent in my ballot.  I did not vote for anybody.  I sent a blank ballot.  I voted in protest against the lousy politicians.  That will give them an idea how I feel.  I will not change my mind until they will treat me as a human being.  I don’t know what I am fighting for.

I love you and I am all yours.

										Silvio


P.S.	My writing paper is running short.  Please send me some.

My darling Annette,

You did not have to be upset because you hurt my feelings.  Your following letters were so sweet that they made me forget it.  They wiped out any traces of hurt as effectively as a wave in wiping out words written in the sand.  You know that I love you more than anything else in the world.  Maybe you do not understand the reason.  You do not know what a letter starting with “Dear” means to a man in the Armed Forces.  You know that many engagements and marriages have been broken during this war.  The men who have been forsaken by the gentle sex are known in Army slang as “Dear John” men.  So you see, the word “Dear” has an icy meaning.  I can’t blame you.  You did it inadvertently.  I know you did not mean it.  I know and feel that you love me as much as I do you.  When I come home, I’ll show you how much I love you and I am going to do everything in my power to make you happy.  And we will be happy.

I am trying my best to be sent home.  I am trying all kinds of tricks: nagging, complaining, or sweet, gentle manners.  I keep my fingers crossed and hope.  Do not worry about me.  There is no danger here.  It’s like being in a small American city.  I can go and see a movie nearly every night and can choose.  Some are many miles away.  This distance I can cover in a few minutes ride.

Yesterday, I was asked if I wanted to take a leave of two weeks to Australia.  I have not had a leave in a year.  I told them that the only leave I want to get is a leave home.  The only people I want to see are my darling wife and my parents.  The only cities I want to see and be in are Lowell and Larchmont with you at my side.

Today, it’s a beautiful summer day.  It’s warm to move around, but it’s comfortable sitting down under a tent.  A gentle breeze is blowing all day long.  This is one thing that I have to be thankful for in this location.  The nights are cool, but not cold.  I need a blanket to be comfortable.

By the time you read this letter, you’ll be in the midst of election fervor.  I would like to be home.  I enjoy being present and hearing the politicians calling each other names and telling the people how good they are and how the world could not turn around unless they are elected.

I have not done much reading recently.  I am going through a cycle when I prefer to dream, walk, talk and joke.

Now it’s four o’clock in the afternoon.  As soon as I finish writing this letter, I’ll take a shower and then go to supper.  Then I’ll wait for the news.  The news has been very good lately.  We will get more and more good news.  Tonight, I’ll go visiting some officers” tents and gossip and talk until I feel sleepy.  Today, I’ve done the usual things.

I love you.  My next birthday we must be together.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

P.S.	I received the New York Times.  Thanks.

My darling Annette,

I’m worried.  Last night, I dreamed that I was riding with you.  I was kissing you when I woke.  This is not unusual, but what made me uneasy was the feeling that you were very skinny.  Maybe the letter you wrote me on the 5th of October had something to do with my dream.

You told me you weigh 127 pounds.  This statement plus today’s description of your feeling of tiredness makes me wonder and worry.  I’m afraid that you have been starving yourself or that you have taken some drugs suggested to you by your fellow office workers.  I would like to know how you achieved your loss of weight.  Please, darling, do not ruin your health or your stomach.  I love you as you are.  Please do not deprive yourself of your food.  You can manage to keep your present weight if you get a nourishing diet.  Meat, fruit, eggs, vegetables, and vitamins will give you food value without being fattening.  I am worried because you lost your weight too quickly.  Please, darling, do not ruin your health.  I love you as much when you are chubby as when you are skinny.

You know more about this island than I do.  I would like to correct a misunderstanding.  You think that there are towns on this island.  They are listed as towns on the maps, but they are not.  They consist of a few huts, shabby and miserable, suspended on poles along the seashore.  I was surprised last year when I was in New Guinea.  I went to see a “town” that was mentioned in official communiques and had made the headlines in Allied newspapers.  I asked my guide where the town was located.  To my surprise, he showed me a few miserable huts!

Yesterday, I heard the good news that the Philippines have been reached by our troops.  That was good news.  News that we have been awaiting for a long time.  This darned world is so badly organized.  Here I am, writing in my tent, comfortable and happy to have received your news.  The weather is ideal.  All is peaceful around here.  Look at you!  Maybe you are cold, but more than that you are worrying about me.  I know you think that I’m in the thick of it.  I don’t blame you.  I’m only made at this darned world.

Take good care of yourself, will you darling?  Do not work too hard.  You know that there is always another day.  

Remember me to Mother and Auntie.  How is Uncle?  I haven’t heard from him or about him for ages.

I love you, my darling.

My darling Annette,

I can’t complain against the mail service.  I have received today the letter you wrote and sent thirteen days ago.

What puzzles me is your repetition of the question “Why shall the natives come back at 12 o’clock?”  I can’t remember the context and how I came to talk about it.  I know I had the natives come to sick call about that time.  What I really meant, I guess, was the appearance, always punctual, of the natives, especially children, at noon.  They came in bunches of two or three and waited for food.  Every kind of food was good for them.  They did not mind to clean the refuse cans or the garbage cans.  They like the Americans.  They used to tell me “America bagoes” - Nipon tida bagoes.”  In my language it meant that the American food was good and the Jap food was not because they had none.  They said that the Americans are good and the Japs are bad.  But I knew what they meant.

I had a chance to observe the life of the natives very closely.  They knew me as “Twau Doktor” - Mr. Doctor to you.  I went to their village and examined one of their sick men.  He was sick to them, but dying to me.  I tried my best, but what can I do to save or cure a man who was literally skin ( dark, wrinkled, hairy skin) and bones and was unconscious and so weak that he could not even move his arms?  I gave him plasma and I think I kept him alive for a few hours.

These natives live in huts along the seashore.  These huts whose floors are elevated about four feet from the ground are sustained by poles of various sizes, from two to five inches in diameter.  They have a floor made of poles or bamboo that are tied to each other by vines or bark.  The roof is made of leaves, dried leaves taken from coconut trees.  It’s surprising that such roofs are waterproof!  They use the same leaves to build the walls.  The hut has only one room that serves as a living room, dining room, and bedroom for old and young, married and single.  

These natives have strong family ties.  I could read in the faces of the sons and daughters of the dying man sorrow and grief mixed with stoic resignation.  The native women of this island do the carrying and the cooking and the resting.  They sit in their huts or outside them and talk and look around all day long.  They don’t have any worries.  They don’t need any shoes or hats.  A piece of cloth from an inch above the breast to the knees is all they need.  I used to tell the boys that they dress like debutantes or movie stars.  I don’t know how they hold their cloth up without any “suspenders!”  They are shy and reserved, stick to their huts, and never move around without the protection of the head of the family.  They hate the Japs.  I guess they have some reason.

The children, I mean the boys, are friendly, natural, playful, vivacious, intelligent, and always on the alert.  At play, they are not different from any other children in the world.  The boys are the happy ones.  Think of it!  Summer time, twelve months a year, swimming, fishing, hunting, playing, twelve months a year!

I am well and love you very, very much.	

										I am yours,

										Silvio

P.S.	 I include two pictures taken recently.

My darling Annette,

I’m glad you were pleased with my bookkeeping.  Do not praise me too much.  I had a course in bookkeeping when I was in high school.  I do not remember much, but enough to settle my accounts.

You should see my hair!  The hair of my temples is getting whiter every day.  We will look the same age, at least when it comes to hair.  When I came overseas, I could count my gray hairs.  It would take me hours now.  Do not worry about it, darling.  I love you as you are.  

I got your colored picture and do not like it.  It makes you look too slender.  I am still wondering and worrying about your loss of weight.  Will you tell me how you did it and will you promise me not to endanger your health?  I have married you when you were... and I loved you.  Please, darling, do not try to get too slim at the expense of your health.  You know that we are going to have many children.  We want them healthy and wholesome.  Don’t you?

I received a letter from Dad today.  Poor man, he tries to keep my morale up.  I guess he has his hands full now: his wife, his daughter-in-law, and now his son.  I guess he  was shocked to hear my complaints.  He has tried very hard now for three consecutive letters to cheer me up and advised me to take it with resignation.  But you know how I feel.  I want to come home to my beloved one.  It’s my whole life, my perpetual desire, my painful yearning, the thing I am dreaming day and night: to come home and be with you.  I feel I’ve done my part and need a rest and all the happiness that only family life can give me.

I got your colored picture.  You are right.  It is not so good.  I like the one you took with Rose.  You don’t mind if the scissors cut through Rose and she is in the basket?  I cherish that picture and gave it the first place in my pocket book.  It’s the picture of you that I always love to see.  You have a charming and natural and beautiful smile.  The smile that I love so much, the smile that made my heart flutter when I first saw it.  Do you remember the outpatient clinic seven long years ago?

I agree with you that the worst is gone by and our silver lining is due and should be around the corner.  I keep hoping... 

I’m feeling well.  I have acquired an air mattress.  My bed is now soft and comfortable to dream of our future happiness.  Life is easy now.  I have no hard work to do and can read until late by the light of an electric bulb.  This helps a great deal because here the nights are very long, twelve hours, all year round.

I love you.  I send you as many kisses as there are stars in the cloudless sky tonight.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I have received the letter you wrote on my birthday, the one you wrote the day the Americans landed at Leyte, and the one of October 22.  I thought and knew that you were worrying about me when they announced the landing on the Philippines.  I made that remark to one of the officers and I was very glad to read the communique that announced the names of the infantry divisions involved.  No, darling, I have not moved.  I’m still on the same island and on the same hill.  I have been here for four months with the exception of three weeks passed at the seashore and one week in the jungle hunting for hungry and famished Japs.  For months now I have not gone through any hardships.  I have enjoyed long rides in my jeep at 30 M.P.H. I did not run any faster because the military police is always on the alert.  I do not ride on jungle roads, but on parkways.  These are as good as parkways anyhow.  You can never imagine how quickly and efficiently American ingenuity changes the shape of the jungle.

I am getting soft.  I am sleeping in a tent that is much better than any building in this part of the world.  I have a cot with an air mattress topped by a bedroll.  It’s like sleeping on a bed with springs.  Last night, for the first time in three years, I slept on white sheets.  I bought them yesterday.  I can dream in comfort now.  I go to the movies at least three times a week.  As a whole, my life is not hard, even though it is empty.  

I like your colored picture.  I am worried about your weight.  You look well but I would hate to hear that you are endangering your health.

I’m going on my thirty-first month of overseas duty.  It’s like a century!  I hope they will speed up this darned rotation.  As far as I am concerned, it’s more a myth than a reality.  I am still keeping my fingers crossed and hoping.

You ask me what color I like best.  I have not seen women dressed in winter clothes for so long that I don’t remember what they look like.  I love you and the color or shape or texture of your coat will not change my heart and my mind.  I would like to answer your desire, but I’m helpless.

I have not heard from Lena for some time.  Only indirectly through Dad.  I wonder what she is going to do.  Some time ago, I thought that she was going to get married.  She is getting old and it’s time for her to make up her mind.  You should be able to give her some advice.

We have quite a little bit of money saved.  We need some more.  I would like to have a house of our own, a brand new one.  I’m sure Dad would build one for me at a good price.

I have no plans for the future.  In any case, I’ll go back to private practice.  I made a living before.  I have a better chance now.  Before I go back, I intend to go back to a hospital at least for a few months.  I have not had a chance to practice any obstetrics for quite a long time.  I need a refresher course.  Maybe St. Joseph’s will do it.  I don’t like to make plans too much in advance.  If everything goes well, I’ll be in this Army for another year or two.  In the meantime, a lot of changes will come.

For the time being, I have only one ambition, one goal, one thought in mind, one desire in my heart: to come home to you for keeps and to be happy again.

I love you, darling.  As always, I am all yours.

My darling Annette,

Today we start our 34th month of married life.  It’s a crime that you and I had to pass thirty-one of those months separated from one another.  I am still asking the question.
How many more?  I have given the best, the cream of my life to the service of our country.  Don’t you think that our country owes us a little bit of happiness?  Don’t you think that our country that has asked and obtained so much from us should give us a break, a chance to be together again and enjoy a normal life, for a while at least?

As long as I live, I’ll never forget another seventh of the month.  It’s June 7, 1944.  Five months ago today.  I had given up any hope to live.  I was trapped for hours and completely surrounded by death and destruction!

What a difference today!  All is quiet and peaceful.  It’s warm during the day, cool during the night.  I’m living securely.  I have a lot of time to read.  I can listen to the local radio station.  I can go to the movies nearly every night.  I can go for a ride in a jeep or a swim any time I want to.  I have a soft bed and electric lights to pass the evenings reading the books I like.

By now, I hope that you are sure that I’m not in the Philippines.  I guess today you went to the polls and voted for the right man.  I sent my ballot to New York three weeks ago.  From what I read in the New York Times, it looks as if there is going to be a close election and Dewey “may” have a chance.  I say he “may” because I know that our present commander-in-chief will be reelected again.  I read some of his speeches.  He has not lost any of his old and well-tried “punch lines.”

You ask me what I think about your new winter coat.  I have been away from civilization for so long that it’s hard for me to give an opinion.  I never look at the fashion and society pages of the Times.  I agree with you that it is expensive.  But if you think that it is worth it, it’s all right with me.  I have spent about $100. on uniforms since I came overseas.  That includes shoes and socks, etc.  I can live very cheaply.  I guess I’ll have to spend a lot of money on clothes when I come home unless I want to look like a beggar in your company.

I’m feeling well.  I got your package.  I like the cigarette lighter and the pajamas.  I have enough of these now to last for many years.  

There is a rumor that the rotation plan will increase its quota.  I’ll let you know when I’ll be notified that I’ll be sent home.  I’m waiting and waiting and hoping.  I long so much to have you in my arms!  I love you, darling, so much that it hurts and makes me suffer.

				I’m yours forever.					Silvio

My darling Annette,

It’s surprising that I’m answering the letter you wrote only ten days ago!

I agree with you that I promised you more than once that I’ll be home with you this Christmas.  I can’t tell you how hard I’ve been trying since this d_____ rotation started.  I’m still trying my darnest to get a trip home as soon as possible.  So far, I had no luck.  So far, only the old men, those who have been in the service the longest, have gone home.  My chance should come.  I am trying very hard to get it very quickly.  This is the only thing I can do.  One day I may burst and that will be the end and I’ll go home.

I’ll start my thirty-second month soon.  I’m fed up and tired of waiting.  I feel that I am treated unjustly.  Thirty-two months without seeing dear ones is as long as an eternity.  These months have been dragging along so slowly, so painfully.  I wish your command will be obeyed.  But there is nothing I can do but complain and curse those who I think are responsible.

No, I’m still here taking it easy for a change.  I’m still in the same place, running the same life, doing the same things day after day.

You tell me that you have winter weather already.  I cannot say that.  It is warmer than ever, but as usual the nights are pleasant and wasted.

It’s a good idea to have a checking account.  I think, however, that it would be better to wait until I get home.  In the meantime, we can get the interest.  You open one if you think you need it.  If you wait for me, we can open a joint checking account.

I’m pleased with the election results.  I’m glad that a few men that I did not like were defeated.  I prefer to have a leader who has experience and is a smart dealer in international affairs.  I feel that we are winning the war.  I want to win the peace and keep a new peace as long as it will be humanly possible.

I’m reading “Vanity Fair” by W.M. Thackeray.  It’s an old novel, written in an old style.  I did not like it during the first dozen pages.  But as soon as I became accustomed to the forgotten words and expressions that are now out of use, I enjoyed it.  I imagine the writer had a lot of fun while he unraveled the happenings in a smooth, liquid, simple but effective style.

The European front has been quiet, relatively speaking.  I expect it to flare up again within a few weeks.  I do not hope, nor believe, that the European war will end this year.  Next year, I am sure Hitler will crack forever.  It will not be soon enough for me!

Until my next letter, my darling, I send you my deepest love.  I’ll dream and dream.  I love you immensely.  Have many, many kisses.


											All yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I’m sorry to disappoint you.  I am sorry and it hurts me to disappoint you again and again.  I cannot make it.  I’ll be able to be with you neither on Roosevelt’s Thanksgiving nor on the old-fashioned New England Thanksgiving.  I’ve tried my best.  I’ve seen many officers.  I have complained.  I’ve threatened.  I’ve pleaded.  I’ve begged.  And I’m still here!  I wonder when I’ll ever go home.  I am dreaming of getting home night in and night out.  I’ve not many days to go before starting my thirty-second month overseas!  Today I start my fifteenth month in combat zones.  How many more?

It’s evening now.  It’s the best time to sit down and write and wonder.  It’s hard for me to write during the daytime.  It’s too warm.  I sweat and wet the paper.  I’m not able to concentrate and think when the temperature is soaring sky high.  Sometimes it’s so hot that it’s hard to breathe.  I can take it.  You complain that I do not write often enough.  I think I’ve been fair lately.  I have not written every night, but at least three times a week.

I heard about the Major you mentioned in your letter.  He was hit not so far away from where I was taking care of my patients.  He died from wounds in a hospital.  I know the chaplain who buried him.  

I am feeling well as usual.  I’m doing the same work.  It’s getting monotonous.  Your mail is coming in regularly and that’s a great morale builder, an oasis in this desert life.  I received Auntie’s Christmas package.  I thank her very much.  I’ll write her a letter.  Wish her my best regards.  We have to take your mother to an oculist when I get home.

Days ago, I sent you a package that included a Japanese flag, a small Japanese food basket, and a bracelet made of seashells.  I made it myself.  I picked the shells and made it.  I used telephone wire and dental cement.  I hope you’ll get it and like it.  You have to buy a small hook.  I could not make one with the things I have available.  

I hope it will not be long until the time I’ll meet you again.  I hope it will not be many months.  Then, I’ll be home to stay and to love you and to adore you, my beloved wife.

My darling Annette,

I intended to write you last night, but I was invited to go to see an amateur hour show.  I thought I was going to enjoy myself.  I was disappointed.  I never saw such a boring show.  It was the corniest show I have ever seen.  I was entertained by the audience.  An amateur magician was trying to show a trick.  Something went wrong and he said, “There must be a mistake.”  One of the audience members screamed, “There are no mistakes - You are the only mistake.”

During the last few days, we have been working.  We have been building an officers’ club.  We worked very hard.  We made a lot of mistakes.  We were all carpenters and we really mixed up things.  Can you imagine a dozen officers working, sweating and sometimes cursing in a sweltering sun?  The club is nothing else but a shack, big enough to hold 24 officers, with tables and a bar where iced-water and beer will be served when available.  It is screened and has a silky ceiling made of parachutes that we picked up in the jungle.  Saturday night was opening night.  We had many visitors from other battalions.  It was a welcome change.

Within a couple of days it will be Thanksgiving.  I’m sorry, darling.  I can’t make it.

The months are piling up.  The time is dragging on slowly.  I’m hoping.  It appears that hope is the only thing that cannot be denied to me.  I have been hoping and keeping my fingers crossed for so long that they are getting stiff.  They have been sending fellows home.  Those that have been in the Army the longest, it appears, have the first choice.  

i include a picture taken a few days ago and developed by one of the men.  As you see, I’m not looking so bad.  How do you like my tropical tan?

It is hot.  I wish I could live for a while in a cold climate.  You are in the middle of the winter weather.  

How do you like your coat?  Does it fit well?  Does it keep you warm?

I am feeling well as usual even though I have not been eating any good food lately.

I love you with all my heart.

My darling Annette,

I’m surprised to read that you have not received any letters from me written between October 23 and 30.  I’m sure I have written to you during that interval.  I’ve been writing a letter at least three times a week and I think this is quite an achievement for a man who does not like to write very often.

Darling, I wish I could tell you when I’ll come home.  When I come, I’ll be told only a few days ahead of time.  I should be sent home soon.  I may be sent home any time from now until next spring.  I am guessing that we will not be separated from each other for more than four or six months at the worst.  I will certainly let you know when I’m notified that I am to be sent home.  You know that I want to come to you more than anything else in the world.

I’m not going to send you the blank you sent me to fill.  I’ll do it when I come home.  I do not need any money for the time being.  

Tonight, I had the best meal in months.  It was done and cooked to my taste.  It was exquisite.  It consisted of tasty roast pork with gravy, applesauce, and fresh potatoes.  I had a piece of banana pie for desert and coffee.  It was all topped by a cool glass of beer.  I am really thankful to those American pioneers who celebrated the first Thanksgiving.  Tomorrow, we will have turkey.  The cooks will be working all night.  They are cooking the fat, heavy turkeys delivered to us today.

I’ve seen a good game of volleyball played by the light of electric lamps (bulbs).  The players really enjoyed it.  It’s too hot to play during the day, but it’s ideal to play during the cool hours of early evening.

I’ve been at the hospital all day.  We had two meetings.  I’ve seen a lot of patients.  It has been interesting.

I’m reading “Babbitt” by Sinclair Lewis.  I like the humor.  It makes me smile.

It’s only thirty-two days until Christmas.  I wish you the best Christmas holidays.  I’m wishing to be able to celebrate them in your arms.

I love you, my darling.

										I’m yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Another Sunday has come and is nearly gone.  The days are dragging on.  Fortunately, I have a few books to read.  I’m passing a few hours every day reading and thinking.  I did not read for a while.  Funny how my disposition and love of reading comes and goes.  For weeks, I may read and enjoy it, one book after another.  Then, right out of the clear sky, I become, so to speak, saturated and don’t feel like reading.  I can’t find a book that appeals to me. 

I’m now reading “Claudia” by Rose Franken.  I saw the stage show that played in New York for months.  I like the book.  It’s not because of the plot or the style which is very simple or the humor that transpires here and there.  I like the story, the life of two married people.  I like the book because it deals with the subject of my dreams.  The personages are living the life I miss, the life I want to live, the emotions I want to experience, the ups and downs of married life.  Have you read the book?  I’m sure you’ll like it as much as I do.

How are you, darling?  Is it cold at home?  I would like to feel chilly and to be in cold weather.  It’s warm here.  I have one hot day after another.  Luckily, I don’t have to walk in the sun for long distances or carry a pack or dig a foxhole.  When the sun is high in the sky, it’s really warm, I could say burning.  I don’t exaggerate when I say that even during the early hours of daylight at 8 or 9 A.M., the sun is as warm as it is at home during the noon hour in July.

I am sweating my chance for rotation.  I went to see the big shots again.  I’m going to keep pounding and repeating my desire until they will be so tired of seeing me around that they will send me home.

Tomorrow, it will be six months since I landed on this island.  The first two months were hell.  The remaining four have been relatively pleasant.  I prefer this island to Australia.  I got good food lately.  I’m eating well now.  I hope it will keep on.

I’ll be very bitter if I’ll not be able to keep the promises I made to you last year to be with you during the Christmas holidays.  If I don’t, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Next year, I want to be home or I’ll burst.

I love you with all my heart.

											I’m all yours,

											Silvio

My darling wife,

I’m surprised to read that you have gone for more than a week before receiving one of my letters.  I have been very particular in observing my self-imposed rule to write you at least every other day.  I’ve been writing often.  I may miss one day here and there.  I don’t always feel in a good mood.  When I’m blue, I prefer to keep my mouth shut and my fountain pen at rest.   You know why I’m blue, don’t you?  Darling, you are not as impatient as I am.  Lately, that’s all I have been thinking about, that’s all I have been dreaming about.  But I’m still here on the same island, in the same spot, in the same tent, and on the same breezy hill surrounded by some greener, heavily wooded hills.

Today I start my seventh month on this island.  I recalled the hour I landed, how I ran for cover, how afraid I was, how jittery I became after the first Jap strafing.  I was jittery and at the same time elated.  For a second I thought I was gone, but instead the plane burst into flames.  I saw the meteoric red flames make an arc in the sky and plunge into the sea.  It’s good to be noble and sacrifice one’s life for somebody else’s.  But when it comes to my life or a Jap’s life, it’s different.  I did not feel any pity for the flier.  I felt elated.  Moreover, I was cheering as if I were present at a football game and my team had made a touchdown.  War is nothing but a game where human life is at play, not for conventional and prearranged rules, but for the life or death of a nation. 

I have been waiting for your writing paper.  Do you know that I received today the letter you wrote on November 16?  It came in ten days!  Is it not fast?  I wish you would receive my mail so fast.

Do not worry so much, darling.  Do not fret so much.  I’ll come home someday.  I can’t tell you when because I don’t know.  I will not promise when because I can’t, but I’ll be home someday.

I saw a good picture last night, “Summer Storm.”   I was peeved at the machine that did not produce a clear sound.  I don’t know if you saw it.  It’s a drama of Russian life before the Revolution.  The acting, scenery, and customs were wonderfully matched.  It was a Russian picture that was Americanized very little.

I feel I’ll not make it for Christmas, so I’d better wish you a peaceful, homelike, quiet Christmas.  I love you, darling, so much that it hurts.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

It is not raining tonight.  It is not cold tonight.  It is calm.  It is bright with moonlight.  A full moon is ascending the starry and cloudless sky.  It’s an ideal setting for revelry and for dreaming.  I’m asking how long?  How long shall I wait?  and yearn? and hope?

I have not heard any famous piano player today.  I have not kissed and rekissed many times the most charming young lady in the world.  I only have missed her.  I am missing her kisses, the touch of her hair, the warmth of her body.  How long?

I have just come back from a show “Sweet Rosie O’Grady.”  It’s a musical.  I had seen it before.  It was a good pastime.

Do you remember the chicken I mentioned in my previous letters?  I had not seen her for three weeks.  Today, she reappeared followed by nine chicks.  Everybody looks at them in wonder.  You should see them.  You should see how gently and delicately they are handled by the men.  I think that if Tokyo Rose could see them, she would change her mind.  I don’t think she would dare to call these men “butchers” as she has in the past two years.  No, she does not like us.  She knows that this division is more than a match for her fellow supermen of the yellow race.

I’ll never be able to make it for Christmas or New Year’s Day.  Another year will go by without seeing us together.  I have not stopped complaining.  I do have but one thing left.  Nobody can deny it to me: to hope.

I am well.  I am reading books.  I’m doing my work.  My life is not hard at present.  It is flowing uneventfully.

The European War is reaching a new climax.  I do not expect any great events until next winter.  The Germans need some more pounding.  They are getting it, gradually and in big doses.  I do not know how long they can stand such a relentless pounding.  I know what I’m talking about from personal and practical experience.

It’s getting late.  The lights will go out at ten o’clock.  I’ll be in bed within a few minutes to dream of you.  I love you, my beloved.

										Good Night,
										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Here I am.  It’s Sunday night.  I had a quiet day, uneventful.  I read for the most part of it.  I went to see a game of softball and one of volleyball.

I have read two hundred pages of “Lost Horizon” by James Hilton.  I imagine that you saw the movie.  To tell you the truth, I was more impressed by the movie than I’ve been by reading the book.  I don’t find any fault with the way it is written, nor with the artful unfolding of the events or the description of the personages.  I do not agree with the philosophy of the book as a whole.  I quite agree with parts of it.  I don’t think the author keeps his feet on the ground.  Occasionally, he is too ethereal.

It has been a cool day.  It drizzled in the early hours of the morning.  The sun has been hidden behind the clouds.  It only came out for a few minutes before sunset to peek around.

Last night, we had a big party at our club.  Beer and liquor were served and talk and more talk was very fluent and exuberant.  I saw a movie and a few newsreels.  The movie was “Wintertime” with Sonja Henie.  I did not enjoy it.  I liked the memories it brought to my consciousness.  Memories of a long time ago.  Memories of a night in Boston, of snow and cold and warm kisses and love untouched by Auntie and Uncle’s anger.  Do you remember?  I was looking as the film unveiled, but my mind was back in the past, experiencing a great pleasure in reminiscing.

I am ready.  I am welcoming the opportunity.  I am hoping for the chance.  I am longing for the good things to experience and to live in the present instead of the past.  I like to reminisce, but I love to dream of the future.  I hope that the future will not be so far off.  It will not be longer than four months from now.

We have to keep our chins up for a little while longer.  

I love you, my darling.  I am eager to give a practical demonstration of my feelings toward you.

										I do love you.

My darling Annette,

I have just come back from the post office where I bought the money order that I include in this letter.  Even though we are around Christmas time, this money order is not a Christmas gift.  I want this money put aside.  It’s time for me to save a special amount of money to be used for the only purpose that I have been dreaming about and looking forward to for a long time.  This is the first $100. to be put in a kit.  We need some more.  This is the beginning and it is going to be spent during our honeymoon.  I don’t say second honeymoon, but our honeymoon.  We are going to pick up right where we left off.  Do you agree with me, darling?

How are you?  Are you through with your Christmas shopping?  How is your mother?  I guess she feels well.  I know that she hates the summer, but likes the winter.  I bet it’s cold in Lowell.  I wish I had some of it here.  It’s warm and dusty.  I rode through a good road, but was it dusty!  I did not mind this so much because the breeze from the speed gave me a feeling of relief from the oppressive heat.  I went to the post office furthest away, fifteen miles from my camp area!

Christmas is not far off.  I see now that I’ll not be able to come home by Christmas and New Year’s.  This will be my third Christmas overseas, my first on this island.  I am wondering how long shall I wait before I’ll go home?

I’m feeling well, as usual.  I’m doing the same things over and over again.  I have the same hope that this darned war will come to and end and give me a chance to be a civilian again.

I keep on with my reading.  I am reading “Young Ames” by Walter D. Edmonds.  I have started it and only read the first hundred pages.  I’m not qualified yet to give a judgment.  So far, it’s at least entertaining.

I wish you a quiet, peaceful Season’s Holidays.  I’ll be dreaming of you and what you are doing during the holidays.

I love you, my darling.  Have all my kisses.

											I am yours,

CORDIAL GREETINGS        XMAS 1944       NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES

										Southwest Pacific
										December 10, 1944

My darling Annette,

I’m peeved about this mail situation.  I do receive yours regularly, but you don’t receive mine.  I have been writing faithfully at least three times a week.  I wonder if some letters get lost.  This is the only explanation.

Before I forget, I’ll try to answer your question.  Is eczema infectious or transmitted from person to person?  The answer is no.  Eczema is a skin disease that has various manifestations.  It seems to be hereditary and due to disturbances of the glands.  Some people suffer from eczema caused by food, etc.  I hope I have answered your question.  I reckon that you wanted to know if it is catchy or not.  It is not.

I got a letter from Paul.  He is in the Philippines.  He has a chance now to learn what war is by personal experience.

Today is a cool Sunday.  This morning we had a rain storm.  It poured for a couple of hours.  Now the sky is cloudy and a soft breeze is blowing from the sea.  It’s comfortable and pleasant to sit in my tent and write without a shirt on.  It’s pleasant to lie down on my cot and dream.  I do daydream a lot.  I keep on wishing and hoping and praying to be sent home.  We have a legitimate right to be happy together after such a long, painful separation.

I’m starving for your kisses and your embraces.  I love you so much and I’ll keep on loving you until my last days.  I’m sure now that I’ll not be home for Christmas nor for New Year’s.  Another holiday gone by far from each other.  Where is the silver lining of our cloud?  How far to go yet?  

I’m getting short of paper, so I have to cut it short.  

I include my picture and a 50 yen Jap note.

I love you with all my heart.

										I’m yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Are the newspapers reminding the American public how many shopping days remain before Christmas?  If they do, you only have twelve days to go.

Yesterday, I took a trip to a nearby island.  Do not worry.  It was a pleasure trip.  I was a guest with other officers of a Navy hospital.  I listened to a lecture and saw some patients.  It was a three hour trip each way.  It seemed to me like a weekend excursion.  We landed in the afternoon, were driven to an officers club, and had a few drinks with ice.   We visited the hospital, had a royal supper with ice cream as a dessert, listened to a lecture on kidney diseases, talked for a few hours, then went to sleep.  I slept for the first time in a year in a real bed and believe me I DID NOT SLEEP WELL!  I am not used to such luxuries.  That island is more a summer resort than anything else.  I enjoyed a peaceful and restful day.

Tonight, I am bitter and disappointed.  I had hopes to be sent home this month and I’m not.  I don’t want nor am I going to write what thoughts are passing through my mind.  I’m bitter.

I read “Young Ames.”  It’s a fictional story of a young American who lived in New York in the middle of the last century.  I have one thing in common with him.  He had his girlfriend always in his thoughts.  I like this expression.  I have you always in my thoughts.  I go a little further.  I have you always in my dreams.  

I love you from the bottom of my heart.  Have a special hug and kiss for New Year’s.


										I do love you.

My darling Annette,

I have not heard from you since December 1.  I have not had any mail for a few days.  I guess I was spoiled by the punctuality with which I used to receive your letters.  For quite a while I got your mail every other day or every three or four days.

How are you, darling?  Is it cold at home?  Have you bought all your Christmas gifts?  I had dreamed so many times what we would have done during these Christmas holidays!  I see that they will not become reality.  I have to be satisfied with the pleasure I got by dreaming.  

I’m puzzled.  I don’t know what to do to get home.  It’s hard for me to find a middle way.  You see, if I mix up everything and antagonize everybody, I am kept here.  They would not give me a break.  If I do a good job, as I have been doing for a long time, they keep me here because they cannot do without me.  They think I’m indispensable.  It’s hard for me to behave in a middle way fashion.  

I told the Colonel the other night what I thought.  I told him that I want to go home.  He answered “What for?  You look healthy.”   I told him that I’ve been married 34 months and that I passed 32 months overseas.  I told him that I know that I’ve done my part.  I know that a break is due to me.  Now that I’ve done my duty to the best of my ability, I no longer consider myself obliged to Uncle Sam.  I think that Uncle Sam has a debt to pay me back.  I told him that it’s time for me to pay my debt to humanity and my own family.  I told him frankly and without beating around the bush that I want to go home to procreate.  I stressed this last point time and time again.

I am physically well, but morally I’m very low.  I have reached the bottom.  I cannot go lower unless I dig a deeper hole.  How long can a man endure it?  I know that this life is not only hard on me, but it’s harder on you.

Hopes and dreams are left to us during these holidays.  Hopes to be reunited soon and dreams of a happy life to come.  I am thankful that, notwithstanding all the physical hardships and dangers I had to experience, I’m still alive.  I’m thankful that though I have been away so long, you are still loving me.  I still love you and will love you always.  I love you today as much as I loved you during our first Christmas holidays seven years ago.  It’s more, it’s deeper, it’s sounder.  My love for you is as much a part of me as are my hands, my heart, my whole being.

My life is running as usual.  I talk, I listen.  I read and I do my work as usual.  I’m now reading “Benjamin Franklin” by Carl Van Doren.  It’s the best biography I ever read.  I like the book.  It’s not a flag-waving book.  It does not make Franklin a man of great virtue, etc. like the stereotyped school books do.  It’s Franklin the man with all his virtues and defects.  It describes the life of the man and all the economical and political background with clarity and realism.  The author does not try to make Franklin an immaculate hero, but the man he really was.  And Franklin was a great man.  One of the greatest men America ever had!  He was mentally so advanced that only a few Americans will ever reach him.  He was politically so advanced that he puts to shame the blabbering politicians of the last few decades.

A few nights ago, I had a great compliment paid to me by my commanding officer.  We had a party.  Liquor was served.  I tasted some to be sociable, but the Colonel got drunk.  He told me and the rest of the officers that my decoration was well deserved and that I was the first man who really deserved it.  You know that when a man in under the weather, as we say, he tells people what he really thinks. 

Today it’s a warm day.  Last night was lovely.  I saw “Casanova Brown.”   I had a hearty laugh.  Very good picture.  

It was cool and I slept soundly until two minutes before breakfast.  Now, at noon, it’s warm.  The heat is mitigated by a soft breeze that caresses my naked chest and arms.  I’m in the same place.  I only changed the position of my cot to another one.  The tent started to leak where I was during a heavy storm.

Until the next letter, I will love you with all my heart.


											I do love you.

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

You may be worrying about me.  You heard that another landing was made in the Philippines.  Maybe you wonder if I took part in it.  No.  I’m still where I have been for the last six months.  I can even state that during the last six months I have not moved my base, my camp, more than a few miles.  I have been on this hill, with short interruptions, since the beginning of July.  I am located about ten miles from where I had my worst and bloodiest experiences on June 7.  I am looking forward to passing a comfortable, peaceful Christmas in camp and a quiet New Year’s Day in the relative leisure of my tent.

Today it has rained most of the day.  It started with a heavy downpour at dawn and kept on all day, gradually decreasing in intensity.  A rainy day here with a tent overhead is a comfortable day.  It’s neither cold nor warm.  It’s comfortable.  It’s pleasant.  The day passed fast.  I read a few hours.  I am reading “Benjamin Franklin.”  I discussed the war and read some newspapers.  I’m receiving the New York Times.  Thank you.  I do not receive the Reader’s Digest.  I have not seen a copy for months.

I hope by now that you have received the Jap flag I sent you more than a month ago.  You’ll let me know if you receive it, won’t you?  I also hope that you received the money order of $100. I sent you two weeks ago.

It’s a week to Christmas.  It’s a week to my third Christmas in the tropics!

I wish you a Happy New Year and many and many to follow.  This coming year, I’ll come home or I’ll burst.  I made up my mind.  Next year, the coming year, I’ll come home, war or no war.  I am tired of seeing these months passing by, accumulating one on top of the other, month after month.

The mail has been slow lately.  I have not read one of your letters for a week.  Some are due any day.  I hope tomorrow.

It’s late.  Taps is played.  It’s slow and melodious, moving like a prayer, inviting like a friend to a quiet and restful night.  The lights will go out soon.

So I’d better bid you good night.  I’ll go to sleep and dream of my love.

I love you.  Have a million kisses and a special one with a hug for New Year’s Day.

My darling Annette,

A few minutes ago, I opened the telegram you sent me while Lowell was getting covered by a snowfall.  The Australian Agencies misspelled my name causing a delay in delivery.  I guess it took nearly a month to come from Australia to this island.

I have tried, my darling, very hard.  I did everything I could imagine to be sent home for Christmas.  I tried and tried but to no avail.  I’m still here.  

It’s now 9 P.M. I have come back from the movies where I saw “Mrs. Parkington” the picture that you probably saw in Lowell a few months ago.  I enjoyed the movie.  It does not come up to the book.  The acting was good and the plot was that of the book as far as practical.

I am comfortable due to the rain that keeps the temperature down.  Again today, it poured cats and dogs.

The hen and her brood of nine chicks came to visit my tent.  The scratched and moved around looking for bugs, chirping cheerfully.  You should see them!  They are vivacious, alert and at the same time very tame.  They are the mascots of the battalion.  They move all around the area, visiting every tent.  The men are getting Christmas packages and the chicks get their share of biscuits and peanuts.  They love peanuts.  You should see how fast they are growing.  Everybody agrees that their chirping produces a sound pleasant to hear, especially to the men that came from farms.  They help to refresh memories of home for them.  Two of the chicks have a yellow tinge.  The men are calling them the “Atabrine chicks.” 

Through the loud speaker comes the music of “Let Me Call You Sweetheart.”  It’s a nostalgic song.  I wish I could sing it to you softly in your ears.

The Germans are counterattacking in force.  This is going to be a surprise for many people in the States.  I dare to say that these counterattacks are to Germany what the last breaths are to a dying man.  I do not expect Germany to last many more months.  It is doomed beyond all hope.

I have finished reading “Benjamin Franklin.”  He was a great man, one of the greatest of America.

I am feeling well, though a lot of the men are suffering from colds.  These nights are made for sleep and I do sleep soundly and dream pleasant dreams.  I have heard you so many times in my dreams.
I wish you again a very Happy New Year.  I love you, I love you, I love you.    Silvio

My darling Annette,

Today is a grand day.  I received three of your letters: November 27, December 10 and December 12.

I guessed right about the emotional conditions you were experiencing when you wrote the telegram.  Do you know that your telegram was and is a masterpiece of lyric?  It told me how you felt.  It told me the surroundings you were in.  It told me as much as if you had written a book.  I know it.  I felt the same.  Do you know that it flashed into my mind the memories of all the rides we took in the snow, of all the parking hours we passed in the cold, unconscious of it and unaware of it until the time of departure?  I can see the piles of snow along the sidewalks.  We will be back to it again.  Our silver lining is around the corner.  Spring will take me home.   Just try to keep your chin up for a little while longer.  When I come back, we will make up for all the time we lost.  We’ll have weeks and weeks alone reserved for ourselves.  The time will come.  I feel it.

Today I start my thirty-third month.  Think of it!  Thirty-three months!  I am not going to make any comments.  I’m not going to complain any more.  I said enough.  I reached the rim of my patience and endurance.

Do not worry about my weight.  It’s just right.  I do not want to put on any more weight.  I don’t like to have to carry around a pot belly and a lot of useless fat.  It requires too much work and I like and prefer to do the least when it comes to physical effort.

I’m sorry for Auntie.  Try to help her.  Believe me, she cannot behave otherwise.  It’s beyond her willpower.  Sympathy will do more good than reproach.  We all have our ups and downs, some more remarkable and evident, some less.  It’s not a difference of quality, but of quantity.  Some have a grade more of nerves and instability, some have less.  Variety is what keeps the world moving.  It’s part of life.  How do you like my philosophizing?  Do you think I’ll make a good philosopher?

Again, I wish you a very Happy New Year.  I’ll be dreaming of you. 

I love you.  A special big, long kiss.

										Silvio


P.S.	I love the poem you sent me.  Thanks.

My own and beloved darling wife,

Your mail has been coming in daily.  Tonight, I received your letters of November 29 and December 4.  A couple of days ago, I read the letter you wrote only eight days previously.

I was worried about your coccyx.  I reread your letter of December 11 and noticed that you do not mention your troublesome coccyx.  I presume that the neuralgic attack has subsided.  I think it would be a good idea if you try to take hot baths to relieve the pain.  When I come home, I’ll take the utmost care of you.  I know that when we will be together, we will forget our personal troubles.

I hope it will not be long.  I hope that the spring will bring us together again.  We were cruelly separated during the spring.  We will reunite in the spring.  I love the spring on the East coast.

I’m still in the same place.  I’m sure, now, that I’ll pass here in peace my Christmas and New Year’s holidays.

My weight is just right.  I was getting too fat, so I had to cut down my food to be just right.  To be a little bit on the heavy side is not healthy in the tropics.  Furthermore, I hate to carry a lot of fat around.  As I am, darling, I feel fine.  You, too, look fine in your last picture, the one I like most.  If only I could put my arms around your shoulders and my lips on your smiling mouth! 

Last night, I saw the movie “Maisie Goes to Reno.”  It’s a silly picture, but funny.  I had a good laugh.  The whole picture is full of unexpected circumstances.  I like to see a picture like that.  One phrase in the movie had the audience in an uproar.  It said “Even the soldiers need a two-week furlough.”  As you know, I and most of us have had seven days to ourselves, I repeat seven days of leisure, during the last three years!  

Here the lights went out.  The whole camp fell into darkness, the radio became silent.  I took a walk on the road that passes a few yards in front of my tent under a starry sky with a sickle-like moon shining right on top of my head.  I walked up to the volleyball court that is illuminated by a different generator and saw the boys playing volleyball.  They are playing a swift, dexterous game.  They put everything they have in them to win the game as if their lives were at stake.

I have been out in the field all day today.  It was hot.  I have not done a thing, just sat down and waited for the time to pass.

Thank you for the package you sent me.  I like the fruit you sent me.  I have already eaten the dates.  They are delicious.  I would much prefer to have one date and that is with you.  We’ll get a lot of them.  We will get a lot of them.  We’ll have one lasting three weeks.  You may as well get prepared.  I will not let you out of my sight, not even for a few minutes.  I’ll follow you wherever you go, even in the ________.  

									
											I love you.

My darling Annette,

I was very lucky today.  I received your letter of December 14.  It reached me while I was getting through dinner.  Your letter was what I needed to make it a perfect dinner.

I had the traditional turkey dinner.  It was very well cooked.  It tasted delicious.  I ate earnestly, enjoying every single bite.  It had all the trimmings including stuffing, cranberry sauce, peas, mashed potatoes, pie and coffee.  We had dinner at three o’clock in the afternoon.  By then I was quite hungry.  When I left the table, I was feeling very good.  Then your letter came, written only ten days ago.  My morale and humor has been very high ever since.  It does not mean that I am happy because I’m not.  I’ll only be happy when I’ll be with you.  No, darling, I am not one of the lucky ones to be sent home.  I’m still here, on my thirty-third month, my third Christmas overseas.  I’m not going to complain.  I’m not going to write what I think.  You can guess it.

The postal service has been good.  I have received your mail regularly.  I got the packages that Uncle and Auntie sent me.  I thank them most cordially.  I received the New York Times.  Please do not renew the subscription.  It reaches me very late, as late as three months.  

I even got a ration of beer.  I drank a few glasses since yesterday.  I have taken one glass a few hours apart so as not to get inebriated.  I don’t like to look silly.

I’m glad I’m not in Europe.  Those poor boys are going through a hard fight.  I am willing to take all the warm weather, but I don’t like to live in the snow and to be soaked and wet in freezing weather.

I had a few days of cool weather.  I had to use my undershirt in the early morning.  This weather invites me to sleep.  I have slept more than I used to.  Today, I have not done one thing.  I moved around the area, hung around my tent, had a nap in the afternoon, read a few articles, saw the time pass by.

The chicken mascot was taken prisoner on this island.  The former one was left behind.  I don’t know where it ended.  Maybe in some G.I.’s stomach!

I am sorry for your aunt.  She is better off after so much suffering and such a long illness. 

I hope you enjoy your Christmas holiday.  I again wish you a very happy New Year with the hope to pass the greater part of it in my company.  It’s this hope that keeps me going and gives me the strength to endure this life.

I love you.  A special New Year’s kiss.

										I am yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I have on my homemade table the Christmas tree that your mother sent me.  I’m very proud of it.  I have been showing it all around.  I even had some fellows come to my tent and look at it.  The caramels and tiny packages are still hanging on it.  I’ll not open them until after New Year’s Day.  I appreciate the cake of soap she sent me.  I have been using one flavor for months.  It’s the only one they sell at the canteen, so I welcome the change.  I guess I got all your packages.  I’ll have enough candy and dried fruit for many months to come.

Lately, I have been reading magazines and old newspapers.  It helps to keep me informed about what is going on in the world and about what other people are thinking about the war.  I got the New York Times edition published after the election.  I’m glad to have received it.  I was curious to know the election results in detail.  The reading gave me some pleasure because it happened as I had imagined it would.

Last night, I did not go to see a movie.  Instead, I went to the hospital to listen to a medical conference.  The movie was a funny one.  I’ve seen a lot of them and did not miss it. I was pleased with my choice.  I have learned something and refreshed my mind.  The meeting was held in a Red Cross hut attached to the hospital.  It was all decorated according to the Christmas spirit.  They even improvised a Christmas tree!  As you know, there are no pines in the Pacific island I live on, so they had to make an artificial one and I confess they succeeded very well.

Our movies lately have been comedies.  They are entertaining and do not have anything to do with war.  I personally dislike any flag waving and so do many other people.  Hollywood’s conception of war is ridiculous and disgusting as are their scenes of life on the atolls of the Pacific Ocean.

The days are dragging so slowly.  I’m looking forward to the coming of the New Year with hope and faith.

I’m reading “Here Is Your War” by Ernie Pyle.  Have you read the book?  The author is very realistic.  He does not exaggerate nor degrade the subject.  Only here and there is he putting in his own impressions.  Sometimes, he makes people believe that the soldiers think that everything is rosy.

I’m feeling well and carrying on as usual.  

I love you and hope to be with you in the near future.
I love you and kiss you.
											Silvio

My darling and beloved wife,

I am at the end of the year.  In two more hours, I’ll start a new, a brand new year.  I don’t have any regrets in seeing this year coming to an end.  I have not experienced any happiness.  I have kept longing for one thing all year round and I have not achieved it.  So, I consider it a lost year.  I wanted badly to come home, but darned it, I’m still here on the same island, in the same spot, doing the same things, hoping the same hopes, yearning the same desires.  I guess I should be thankful that I am still living and will see the light of another year.  

I hope the year that will start within less than two hours will bring me what I’ve wanted for so many eternal months.  This time, this year, I can say nearly with certainty that we will meet during the coming year.  The coming year will be the silver lining that we have been looking forward to for so long.

Tonight, I saw a picture.  It was a murder story.  It was so intricate and mysterious that even though I know who committed the crime, I do not know how it happened and why it happened.  I like the short newsreels.  They are very interesting, news of this mad world at war.

I rode back to my tent, had a glass of beer and started writing this letter.  I had to close the year by talking to you, my beloved wife.  I’m sorry that at the stroke of midnight, while sirens scream and people get wild in Times Square, I’m not with you to give you my special New Year’s kiss.  Nobody can stop me from sending it to you.  Here, darling, my best and longest kiss for the coming year!  I’ll love you in the coming year more deeply and more strongly than ever before.  My love will be kindled by the bright hope of our future reunion.

I love you.  I love you with all my heart.
Happy New Year, my beloved wife.

									I’m yours, all yours,

									Silvio
