My darling Annette,

Your mail is reaching me regularly and fast.  Yesterday morning, I received your letter of April 19!  I have not received any letters you wrote between April 11 and 19.

I thought as you do about the loss of our late President.  I’m glad that Mussolini died in a way that he highly deserved.  Hitler will follow him at any hour now unless he has already trespassed to the unknown.

Your premonitions and feelings of apprehension on April 1st and 2nd corresponded exactly to my state of mind.  During those two days, I was at the front lines and a lot of Japs were killed.  It was dangerous going for a while.  I was scared stiff only one night.

At sundown, I had recovered into my hole.  I was tired.  I had a long walk through steep hills during the hottest part of the day.  I had been worrying about some patients and worked hard to save their lives.  At sundown, the patients were evacuated and doing well.  I relaxed.  I lay down and fell asleep as soon as darkness and silence enveloped me.  

At about ten o’clock, I was suddenly awakened by an explosion twenty yards from me.  I had slept soundly.  I opened my eyes and was dazed by the light of the full moon shining in the sky and looking down at me.  The flood of light and another explosion scared me.  They both came during that confused state of mind and dull perception that exists between sleep and full consciousness.  For a second, I felt paralyzed and shrank into a bundle, then started to listen and orient myself.  A few scattered rifle shots.  I grabbed my rifle.  By that time, I had full consciousness and was ready to sell my life at a very high price.  My legs started to shake.  They quaked, first one, then both together.  I was helpless as my lower body kept on trembling.  My hands and arms and head were under complete control.  Within a few minutes, I was oriented.  I knew that there was no danger.  Still my legs kept on quaking.  I got sore at them, then got a kick out of it and told them to keep on shaking if they so desired.  I was normal again and went back to sleep as if nothing had happened.  

By the sound of the explosion and the crackling of the rifles, I was convinced that somebody not far from me was hearing some noises.  I knew the noises were not caused by Japs.  I can distinguish in a short moment between a Jap and a roving animal in search of food.

As a whole, these two campaigns have not been very exciting.   As I told you, I made two landings.  I have been here for 35 days.  I was on the other island for 28 days.

I’m waiting to be sent home any month now.  I’d like to come home in the summertime.  We always had fun in the summer.  Didn’t we start in the summer?  We can start again and this time for good.

I love you and am all yours.

										 Silvio

P.S.	 I hope you had a good time in New York.

My darling Annette,

I regret that you had to worry about my welfare while I was basking on a luxuriant tropical beach.  When I wrote you on April 9, I guessed that the campaign was over.  I was not certain, however.  I was prepared for anything.  It came out that my guess was right.  A couple of days afterward, I was sent to the beach.  This is where I am now and where I have been for more than three weeks.  

I have been on this large island for nearly seven weeks.  I did not make a beach landing.  I did not come in and start to fight.  I landed, established a camp, hung around doing nothing for a few days, and then moved to the front a few miles away.  I can’t tell you where I am.  I know I’ll be here for some time and then I hope I’ll come home.  

I’d better hurry if I want to keep my date of July 3.  I have two months to go.  I’ll try to make it.  I’d love to come home in the summer.  Where shall we go?  Do you have any plans?  Are you saving any gasoline?  How is the car?  Is it in good shape for trips around New England?  How are the tires?

The European war is rapidly coming to a close.  Within weeks or maybe days, the fighting will be over.  This last week has brought one victory after another.  I have been waiting for the news every day at 9 A.M. Every day the news came in better and better, astonishingly and amazingly.  I’m waiting now for the last straw, for the end of the war in Europe.

I’m well rested.  I have started to read books to pass the time.  I’m going to study and practice phonetics.  By now, I should be able to speak well, but I don’t.  I still have a lot of ground to cover.  I like it and it’s a good pastime.

I have seen two good pictures during the last two evenings, “Kings Row” and “Meet Me in St. Louis.”  I enjoyed both.  I appreciated the acting and the scenery of “Kings Row” because I had read the book and knew the plot.  The director stuck to the text more than I had dared to expect.

I have good weather.  It’s warm, especially in the early hours of the morning before the breeze from the sea starts to blow.  During the day, it’s comfortably warm.  The feeling that I’ll come home soon is still with me and growing stronger as my love for you is growing stronger and stronger as the time passes.

I love you.  Have many kisses.

										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I cannot tell you where I am at present.  I have been here for forty-four days.  How long I’ll remain, I don’t know.  I hope I’ll leave soon.  I have been hoping for so long that I wonder how long I’ll be able to stand it.  We have been apart for such a long time!  We have sacrificed so much!

I’m still here in the Philippines.  The place I live in is lovely and the climate is ideal, but I am not happy.  The end of the war in Europe will speed up this so-called rotation.  They even promised those of us who have been serving so long a discharge from the Army.  I wonder: will they?  I’m getting tired of this life.  I want to be home.  I want to be happy.  I want to enjoy the happiness I have suffered and struggled so long to achieve.

I received your cheerful letter of April 29.  I’m glad you got my news.  I was sorry to read that you were worrying about me while I was enjoying a quiet, peaceful life on this island, one of the largest and most beautiful of the Philippines.  

I have not done much lately.  I read a book “Martin Eden” by Jack London.  I like the first half of the book where the author describes the hardships and tribulations that the young Eden had to experience.  I like the style.  I like the subject.  The first part is a love story, a glowing love story of a man who loves sincerely and is full of ambition.

The first third of the month of May was really history making.  The news has been marvelous.  It helped to bring my morale sky high.  I think that it will not be long before we’ll have “peace on earth for our time.”  And you and I will live those years in love and peace.  I am so anxious to come home that I cannot express it in words.  I am so anxious to have you in my arms, to kiss you, to love you with all my body and soul!  It will not be long!  I hope.  I hope so deeply, so sincerely.

I wonder if you are in Larchmont or New York or Washington.  Did you take the trip to New York?  I’d love to hear from you.

I love you, my darling, with all my heart.

										I’m all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Here I am, in the middle of May and still in the Philippine Islands.  I had expected and felt certain to have been chosen and sent home in the May rotation quota.  I had planned to reach home in June and to be with you for your birthday.  I have been dreaming and planning what we were going to do, what a good time we were going to enjoy.  You can imagine what a shock to me was the news that I was not chosen in the May quota.  I remained speechless and stunned.  I could not believe it.  So sure was I to be sent home that I did not believe it until I saw the list of the names that were selected.

I’m now waiting for June.  I was told that I may be chosen.  I do not believe it.  I’m skeptical and bitter.  I don’t think that there is any justice even though we hypocritically claim that we fight for justice and fairness.  I’ll wait for June and hope.

I feel that this letter is not very cheerful.  It’s what I feel and only a fraction of what I feel.  I’d better not write my deep feelings.  The above-mentioned details are my trouble.

Otherwise, I am faring well.  The weather is ideal.  It’s warm, but the breeze keeps us cool.  The food has been excellent.  I have had fresh eggs and bacon for breakfast and steaks or pork chops or roast beef for dinner and supper.  A few days ago, I made the remark that in 1943 in New Guinea we had meat twice every six months.  Now we have meat twice a day.  We have made great progress, don’t you think?  

The movies have improved remarkably.  In New Guinea, we used to see pictures one year old or more and most of them were second-rate pictures.  During the last two evenings, I saw two pictures that were released only a short time ago.  I mean less than a year.  I saw “Wilson” an excellent picture with a first-class cast and true to history.  The scenery and the interiors of the White House, the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, and the House of Representatives were realistically filmed. 

Last night, I saw “A Song to Remember.”  It’s the story and love life of Frederic Chopin and George Sand.  The music was sublime, the acting superb.  I like Paul Muni.  I always will like him.  He brings me a sweet remembrance, a gem in my memory, our first movie.

I love you, my darling.  Hoping to kiss you within a few weeks.

										I’m all yours,

My darling Annette,

I received your letter of May 7.  It was written the night before.  Then, you did not know that the war in Europe was going to end within hours.  I’m glad that that war is over.  I hope that this war will end soon and give me a chance to come home for good.

I received a letter from Paul.  He is located somewhere in the Philippines.  He is getting along as usual.  When you go to New York and visit Rose, for goodness sake do not believe what she tells you.  So far, every visit you paid her has cost me mental anguish and more than that to you.  Do not believe her!  You know that I love you and that you are the only woman I ever loved deeply, whole heartedly with all my body and heart.  Moreover, there is no better wife and woman than you in the whole world.  I have one aspiration, one ambition, one urge, one desire: to come home and be with you.

I love you, my darling, with all my heart.

I am well.  I hope to see you soon.

My darling Annette,

I’m surprised to read that you have not received any mail for days.  I have written to you regularly with the exception of the last ten days when it was physically impossible to sit down and jot down a few lines.

I have been in the jungle, in the thick, humid rain forest hunting for Japs.  It was physically hard, but not mentally.  The enemy has lost any will to fight.  This short campaign has concluded very successfully.  I have not been busy at all.  What has bothered me the most has been the rain and the mud.  I don’t mind climbing hills and mountains and crossing streams, but I do not like walking in the rain.

I’m back at camp now for another good rest and good food.  I get tired of eating the same food day after day.  I like variety and like to eat the food that has been cooked for me.  In the field, everybody does his own cooking.

Your financial report pleased me considerably.  I don’t think you have spent much money.  I think you have balanced your budget very well and saved a lot of money.  I fully agree with you.  You must help your mother.  She has done so much for you.  She has been a good mother and she is a grand mother and no amount of money will ever pay for her sacrifices.  I am really proud of my wife and very thankful to be blessed to have a girl like you for my life’s companion.

You have lost a lot of weight.  You look stylish.  I don’t like your hat.  Why didn’t you crack a smile for me?

I am waiting for this point system to start to work.  I have 52 points for the time I have been in the service, 37 for overseas, 15 for battle stars, and 5 for a decoration.  I have 109 points, 24 points more than required for discharge.  I hope this will send me home soon.  I don’t expect to be discharged, but I am waiting to be sent back to the States. 

You do not need to worry about me, darling.  I know how to make myself comfortable in the jungle better than anybody else in this Battalion.  I know how to take care of myself better than anybody else.  It happened time and time again, when everybody was soaked and wet and I was the only one who was relatively dry.  I have been in the tropics for three years and through many campaigns.  I was never sick, never lost a day.  I was never scratched.  I never suffered from any skin disease or malaria.  It’s a rare record.  And I’m proud of it.

I’m writing to you from a sandy beach overlooking a calm sea.  I had a swim last night and will have another today.

I expected to be on the way home by now but Chapman pulled his rank on me and took my place.  THE SKUNK!  I’m waiting for my chance now and hope to be home soon.  I’m sure I’ll be home during the summer.

Have a special kiss and loads and loads of love.

											I’m all yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

Last night’s news elevated my spirits to a new high.  It said that at the end of June, many thousands of veterans from the Pacific Theatre will be sent home and will be on the way home.  I stand very high.  I’m one of the highest in the Regiment and Division.  I expect to be chosen among the first bunch.  I don’t know if I’ll be able to be home by your birthday.  I’ll try my best.  I’m sure I’ll be home some time around your birthday.  I think my time is getting closer and closer.  I don’t like waiting. 

How are you, darling?  Are you visiting New York?  Have you got your vacation with pay?

I have been back on the beach for a few days.  I had a good rest and felt like doing nothing for a few days.  I just rested.  I have not had any excitement in this last operation.  I slept on a litter all the time.  I have not heard any Jap bullets whistling overhead.  What tired me was the nervous tension.  I have been overcautious and did not take any chances.  As you see, I followed your advice to the letter.  Everybody around here has been very cautious and careful.

I’m now walking in a haze.  I’m dreaming of my arrival home, of what we shall do.  I have many plans and many dreams.  I don’t know if they will be realized.  I know reality is always different from dreams.  However, I plan to be home for a few days, doing nothing, just sitting and eating and sleeping, carefree and free from any engagement.  How do you like the idea of making no plans?  We’ll do what we feel like on the spur of the moment.  How do you like the idea?  Let our mutual desires and pleasures be our planners.

Have you received any letters from my folks?  I have not written them for a while.  Drop them a line and tell them that I am faring well.  

How is everybody at home?

If I’m not home to kiss you a Happy Birthday, I wish you a very Happy Birthday and many, many years of happy married life with me.  We’ll be together in the future.  I consider this long separation as a thing that cemented our love even stronger than it was before.  On this our 38th month of separation, I love you more than ever before and I am more eager, more anxious to be back with you than ever before.

I hope to have you soon in my arms and to kiss you so many times that my lips will be numb.  I love you with all my heart.

										Yours,
										Silvio

My darling Annette,

One month has already passed since the end of the European war and the introduction of the point system and I am still here waiting to be sent home.  I have 23 points more than are necessary to be discharged from the Army.  I don’t expect to be discharged soon, but I do expect and deserve to be sent back to the States.  I already foresee that I’ll not be able to keep my “date” with you on your birthday.  I regret it.  Do not blame me, but blame those that you know are responsible and that you very appropriately call “inhuman.”  I am coming to the conclusion that in this world, people talk a great deal about loving thy neighbor and all similar thoughts while they thrive on sadism.  It seems to me that some people are staying awake night after night trying to find a way to make life more miserable for their neighbors.  It may sound like a pessimistic outlook on life, but I feel it’s an objective observation of human nature, at least human nature in the Army.

I hope you have received some of my rare letters.  I have been unable to write more often.  I hope from now on I may be able to keep my appointments with you regularly.

Lately, I have been moving around.  I hope I’ll be settled down soon, not here, however.  I don’t like this place.  It’s too warm, muggy and damp.  There is none of that breeze that I’m used to.

As I told you in my previous letter, there is no danger here.  These Japs are no match for us.  So far, one Yank is worth two hundred Japs.  It may sound unbelievable, but it’s a fact.  I’ve seen a lot of dead Japs, too many, in all states of decomposition.  I have not been busy at all with the exception of the usual chores.

I’m well and have not lost any weight.  I think I’m putting on some weight.

You asked me for a snapshot.  I’ll not be able to get one for some time.  By then, I hope you’ll be able to look at the original and feel the original instead of a picture.

The point system is due to start any time now that the rotation is dead.

I hope to hear some news about your vacation that is supposed to start at the beginning of June.  I hope you have a good rest and a good time. 

I love you very, very much.  Have so many kisses and a big one, a special one for your birthday.  I love you with all my heart.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Your complaints are more than justified.  I know I should write more often.  I know that I let days and weeks go by without sending a note.  I know and regret to say that I cannot help it.

The rainy season has begun.  It rains as bad as it did in New Guinea.  I cannot carry any paper with me because it gets wet quickly.  This campaign is nearly closed.  Soon, I’ll go back to the original camp.  I may move back any day now.  I hope this is my last meeting with the enemy and hope to be on my way home very soon.  I agree with you.  What are they asking from a man?  Is not human endurance limited? 

At present, I’m one of the few officers in this Regiment that came overseas with the Division.  I figure that the point plan will get me home soon.  During the rotation plan, only a couple of medical officers who distinguished themselves went home on rotation.  Both had a month more overseas than I did and had gone through one more campaign.  All the rest were men who were not trusted or did not behave in front of the enemy as they should.  Do you remember Sleeter?  He came overseas with me and was my tent partner in Australia.  During the Biak campaign, he turned yellow.  He started to cry and shake like a scared baby and was unable to help any wounded man.  He and men like him were sent home on rotation.

I expect without fail to be home during the summer.  I’ll be with you for our eighth anniversary of our happy acquaintance, the first couple of days in August.  I claim it’s the first, you the second of August.  By then, the summer heat will start to decline and we will relive the days of our first acquaintance by visiting the places we loved.

I’m feeling in good shape.  It’s a miracle to have gone through hell and still be in good condition.  In 38 months overseas, I have not lost one day of work.  There are not many men who can boast of that.

Looking forward to the day I’ll have you tight in my arms and your lips on my mouth.  I send you all my love from the deepest of my being.

									I love you, darling.

My darling Annette,

You should see the mud in this camp area!  It is thick and ankle deep.  I need a chart to move from my tent to the aid station or the dining table.  I need a map to chart my course!  In some places, the mud is only a few inches deep.  In others, it’s knee deep.  It’s a gray, sticky, foul-smelling mud.

It has been raining for days with short intermissions.  I wish they would move us out of here and back to our base camp where there is no mud.  I am thankful, however, that I have a tent to keep the rain off and my comfortable bed to keep me warm during the night.  This is far better than sleeping on the muddy ground and in the rain.

I expect soon to move to a better place where I can see a movie occasionally and be at ease to write you for as long as I want.  I have been in the jungle for four weeks.  I hope that this is my last round before coming home.  I feel that I had all I wanted and more.

I have not received any letters from you for more than a week.  Your last letter was written May 23.  It’s more than three weeks!

As I told you, I expect the point plan to be put into effect soon.  I know now, to my deepest regret, that I’ll not be able to make it home by your birthday.  I am sorry to have to pile up your disappointments one on top of the other.  I’ll be home soon and happily we will forget all these delays.

I love you and send you a special kiss for your birthday.

My own darling Annette,

I am very sorry to have to disappoint you again.  I do hope, however, that this will be your last and my last disappointment.  I can’t tell yet if your prayers and wishes will be realized.  I mean that I am chosen and sent home during the month of June.

If I am not, I’ll go to the hospital and work my way home through the medical channels.  I’m getting tired of people who are inhuman, cruel, sadist, unjust, and bestially mean.  How do you like this string of adjectives?  I’ve read a few tragedies of Shakespeare.  Can he find words and can he call names and use adjectives!  What a man!

I’m in camp.  It still pours.  I’m still going through the ordeal of charting my course to and from the mess tent, through the thick, clayish, grayish mud three times a day.  I feel well otherwise.  

I guess today you’re back to work.  I bet you had a good time and feel better.  The trip helped for the present to forget our regrettable and delayed reunion.  

I don’t think it will be long until my lips and yours will not be separated but pressed against one another.

										I do love you.

My darling and beloved wife,

On my return to base camp yesterday morning, I received the letters you wrote from Larchmont.  Yes, you are back to Larchmont and alone.  How long can we stand this writing, deferring, delaying, and hoping, always hoping and more hoping?  I promise that this was your last trip alone to visit my folks.  From now on, we’ll be together.

Within a week, you’ll celebrate your birthday and I will not be there to give you my special kiss that I have been saving for so long!  I’m not going to tell you that I hope that next year we will be together, but next year we will be together.

I’m sorry to say that during June, no medical officer has been sent home on rotation.  Now the point plan is going into effect.  I expect it to function at any moment.

I am on my 39th month overseas.  How could you stand it so long?  We have paid a very high price for the victory!  As the time approaches for my return home, I feel that I have done my duty and that you have shared nobly my anxieties and sufferings.

When peace will come and the people of America return to their farms and factories building goods for the people to use, when the country, victorious, strong, powerful, feared and respected by all nations, will flourish and achieve undreamed and unheard of greatness, we will be proud, knowing that we have contributed our share.  It will not be the America that we inherited.  It will be our America, the America that we helped build by sacrificing the best years of our lives.

I have returned to camp.  I’m glad and relieved.  I’ll write you more often.  I’m glad I left that muddy “piss pot” pig’s pen place.  I detested it.  It was a hell of a place.  It smelled like a latrine and worse than a pig’s pen.  The only good feature about it was the feeling of security.  There were no Japs around for at least a couple of miles.

This campaign has lasted only five weeks.  It was not very hard and less risky.  The Japs did not have a chance.  A couple of years ago, a Yank was as good as fifteen Japs.  Now the relation has changed remarkably.  A Yank is as good as five hundred Japs.  It seems incredible, but it’s a fact.  That is the relation between our losses and the enemy losses.

I’m glad that you decided not to see Rose.  Your meeting her foretold letters that I don’t like to read.

As July approaches, so approaches my getting home, so approaches the realization of my dreams.  I’ll be kissing you soon.  I love you with all and every one of the billion cells in my body and my whole soul.
							I’m yours,			Silvio

										June 26, 1945

My darling Annette,

I received your not too cheerful letter of ten days ago.  I understand how you feel.  Multiply it by a hundred and you’ll guess how I feel.  I do not know what I can possibly do to be sent home.  I’ve tried everything but smashing the brains of those responsible.

Do not think for a fraction of a second that I like to be overseas.  I have been overseas for 38 whole months.  Who likes to live the life of a French criminal confined to islands much worse than Devil’s Island?  Who likes to live a life that has all the restrictions of a condemned criminal of the French Empire with an addition of the perpetual, continual, exasperating thought of losing one’s life at any moment?  No, darling, nobody wants to live such a life!

What in the world makes you think that I do not want to come home when that has been my main thought and inspiration for the last 38 months and four days?  

I know it’s heartless to leave you home waiting for mail day after day.  But what can I do?  I was in the jungle.  I was in mud and rain.  I was in contact with the enemy.  I’ve seen more dead Japs in the last month than I ever did before in the same length of time.  I had a Nip killed within ten yards from me.  

However, in this last campaign, it was the terrain that was difficult more than the Japs were dangerous.  You don’t know, darling, the effort and the care it took me to keep dry the paper that I used to write you those rare letters.  I wrote you every time I knew I could send you a letter by boat or plane.   You don’t have any idea of what I had to do to get the money order I sent Auntie to buy flowers for your birthday.  Do you know that it took three weeks to get that money order and that three different persons contributed to my getting it?  I was lucky I got it when I did. 

But, don’t worry, darling.  Think how lucky you are that your husband is alive and healthy!  There is more than one wife married to a doctor who does not have any hope of seeing her dear husband any more.  I know two medical officers who will never see home and their loved ones.

As a whole, darling, we have to be thankful for so many things!  You are healthy and beautiful and chic.  I am well.  I came out of all these campaigns with not a scratch on my body, with not a blemish on my mind, with not a disease to afflict me.  But what is more important than anything else in the whole world and universe is that our love is standing firm and wholesome, tried by all these years of separation and war and tribulation.

Be patient, darling, and keep your chin up.  It will not be long now.  I’m sure of one thing.  I will not go through any more campaigns.  This one was my last campaign.  This is definite.  Don’t you feel better now?

Be patient.  It will only be a matter of weeks and the time is getting nearer and nearer.  I know with assurance that I will be loving you during this summer.  I feel it.  I know it.

Meanwhile, darling, let’s hope and dream until the day when we will start to really live again.

											I love you.

											Silvio

										June 29, 1945

My darling and dearly beloved wife,

It’s only a few days to your birthday and I will not be home to kiss you, to give you a special Happy Birthday kiss.  I had so many disappointments and caused you so many disappointments that I should get inured, but I am not.

I guess my trip home is not a far off hope.  Things are definitely shaping according to my heart’s desire and toward the ideals and dreams I have been yearning for.  It is definitely a question of weeks.  I’m sure that I don’t have to go to battle again.  I don’t feel, I know that my foxhole days are a thing of the past, something to remember.

It’s a lovely day here in Mindanao, I should say somewhere in Mindanao.  The sky is partially covered, a weak sun is shining dimly.  A breeze blows from the slightly rippled sea.  There is a lot of activity going on in the camp.  I hear a saw, rhythmically cutting a grove.  I hear hammers banging.  We are rebuilding the camp, making it more comfortable, cleaner, more pleasant to the eye. 

Recently, I found out the reason why the song “The Monkeys Have No Tails in Zamboanga” started.  The monkeys have tails, long, agile tails.  These tails are indeed as long as their bodies.  I have seen many monkeys.  I saw them in a state of independence and freedom, jumping and moving freely in the rain forest.  They all had tails.  However, when the first Americans landed on this peninsula some forty-five years ago, they were surprised to see the local children climb the coconut trees with such an ease and confused them with the monkeys.  The song is not so flattering to the local population.  It calls them monkeys.  It seems that the people do not mind it.  They love the ditty with a couple of words changed.  Moreover, they made it their city song.

I saw a picture last night: “Practically Yours.”  It was a good picture.  I enjoyed it.  I like to see Claudette Colbert acting.  I think she is one of the best actresses on the screen.

I’m back to my books.  I have started to read again.  At the present time, I am reading “Leaves of Grass” by Walt Whitman.  He is unquestionably the greatest and the really and thoroughly American poet.  He is not only original, but also simple, easy to understand.  He can express in a couple of lines a thought that would take me a thousand lines to make clear. 

I have been writing to you faithfully since I came back from the campaign.  You know that I love you and that I do not want you to suffer and worry.  You know that I love to write to you, to talk to you, to tell you how I’m faring.  Sometimes, I can’t write.  I am physically incapacitated to write.  The battlefield is not a pleasant place to write.  I’m going to write you often from now on.  I hope that I don’t have to let days and days pass by without sending you a letter.

During the campaign, I always thought of you.  I thought of you for hours.  I had all night free to dream.  It helped me to forget my surroundings and live in a world of my own.

I am waiting to see the realization of my dreams to be with you.  What we actually will do will depend on our wishes at that time.  I want to be with you.

I’m feeling well.  I’m hoping to leave soon.  Meanwhile, I wish you a Happy Birthday.  Have all my love and many, many kisses.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

It hurts me to read that I have been the cause of too much worry.  I don’t blame you.  I feel the same way when I don’t receive your mail.  

It was right that I was in a so-called “rest camp.”  It was a rest camp in the sense that I did not have to move and dig a foxhole and sleep on the ground and eat rations.  I was in action and I was not.  I was not in action because I slept on my cot, ate at a table, and took it easy physically speaking.  I was in action because Japs were killed not far from where I had my camp and there were rifle shots that pierced the air nearly every night and our men were killing Japs by the dozens every day.  As I said, I was physically resting.  Our men are so good that they are able to inflict terrific casualties upon the enemy without even getting a scratch.  I told you that one Yank is worth five hundred Japs.

The camp I was talking about was not the real camp.  Now I’m in camp.  Now I can see a movie nearly every night.  I can write at my ease.  I can read as long as I want to, can go out for a joyride in a jeep.  I can listen to the radio, I can joke and laugh and not be under the apprehension of being hit at any moment.  I can fully relax and with a tranquil mind, enjoy reading poetry.

Darling, I really did not want to worry you.  I did not want to give you a realistic picture of my situation.  I tried to mention only the pleasant features of my camp.  I think that it’s enough for ME to suffer.  Yes, I did not write to you so often.   I wrote to you every four or five days.  I am sure my letters will reach you.  The communications between the base camp and the battlefield were irregular and not on a daily basis.  Sometimes, a letter had to wait for days before it could be sent forward.   Moreover, I was short of writing paper.  I was supposed to be hunting Japs for two weeks and instead I stayed out for five weeks.  That’s the reason why in each letter I wrote you, I told you to write Dad and tell him that I was all right.  I did not have stationery for both of you.

But, don’t worry, darling.  I’m trying to make it up now.  Since I came back nine days ago, I wrote you five letters.  Probably you have already received some and you will get the others soon.

I don’t know when I’ll leave for home.  It’s a question of a week or weeks.  It all depends on the transportation facilities.  Don’t worry, darling.  I’ll be home soon and you’ll be tired of having me around you all the time.  I’ll be with you and I mean with you and as near to you as it will be physically possible.

I love you so much.  Have a special kiss for your birthday.

Happy Birthday! My darling wife,

I like to dream that I am home.  I had a good night’s sleep.  I woke up.  It’s still early.  You are sleeping noisily, breathing rhythmically.  Your eyes are closed, your mouth is closed with well-shaped lips.  I look at you.  I wonder shall I awaken you with a kiss?  I hesitate for a second, then irresistibly attracted by your lips, I kiss you a Happy Birthday.  It’s a long, gentle kiss.  You feel it and open your eyes, semiconscious but happy at how a new year starts.  Many more kisses will follow.  I’ll empty my heart.  I’ll wish you all the happiness in the world.  I’ll caress you, I’ll kiss you some more.  I’ll kiss your lips again, your cheeks, your eyes, your nose, the tip of your nose and your neck.  I’ll hold you tight to me.  I’ll love you.  I’ll tell you how much I love you, how much you mean to me and how happy I am to be with you.  I’ll tell you that I’m the happiest man in the world.  I’ll kiss you some more and more and more.  It’s wonderful to dream.  I don’t dare to think of my life in the tropics without my lovely dreams.

How long shall I keep on dreaming?  I wanted so badly to be with you today.  However, I’m still here, many thousand miles apart.  I’m still on Mindanao.  It takes a long time to organize this point system.  It will never be soon enough for me.  I’m waiting.

I read a great deal.  At present, I’m reading a book of psychology, poems by Whitman, and “The Razor’s Edge.”  I’m trying to practice my phonetics.  This alone will tell you that everything around me is back to normalcy.

I see movies often.  I have beer to drink.  I take a glass when I’m thirsty.  I’m feeling tops.  I feel in perfect condition to come home and enjoy a good vacation with you always with me.

I do love you very, very much.

								I am all yours body and soul,

My darling Annette,

You were wondering why my moods were so different and discordant between June 6 and June 9.  You now know the real reason for the sudden change.  I’m still in the Philippines.  On June 6, I had hopes to be sent home any day.  On June 9, I knew that I was not going to be sent home for many weeks to come, henceforth, the change in my outlook and my morale.

Today, a month from then, I feel hopeful.  I think that now it’s a question of WHEN, not of if.  I’m sure to be sent home.  I’m sure that the war, as far as the fighting is concerned, is over for me.  I’ll be coming home as soon as transportation is available.  How long it’ll be I don’t know.  Maybe tomorrow, next week, or within a few weeks.  I know it’ll not be too long.

My days are running smoothly.  I have an easy life.  I perform my regular duties and have a lot of time free to read.  I have read many books.  I’m still reading.  At present, I am reading a play by Eugene O’Neill, “The Razor’s Edge” by Somerset Maugham, and a book on the history of the development of philosophy and science.  This is heavy and requires a lot of mental concentration.  So, I switch around.  I interchange heavy literature with light.  I have seen a picture every night.  I have to make up for the time I lost when I was fumbling in the thick wind.

I include here a picture taken a few weeks ago in front of my tent.  I felt in a joyful and playful mood.  A sergeant snapped the picture.  I thought he was kidding.  I got it yesterday.  I hope you like it.  You can see the sea.  It’s beautiful, ever changing in hue, some days smooth as glass, other days full of ripples and wrinkles, other days choppy, turbulent, gloomy and threatening.

As I see it, I don’t think I’ll be home before August.  I feel, however, I’ll be with you to celebrate our first date.  Our first date means everything to me.   It was a happy turning point in my life and its memory is sweet and divinely pleasant.  You had fascinated me.

											I love you.

My darling Annette,

The days are dragging on slowly.  I’m waiting patiently for the day when I’ll be told that I’m going home.  It will not be long.  It’s all settled now.  It’s a question of means of transportation and its availability.  I wish these days would run faster.

I have not received any mail for some time.  I don’t complain, however.   I have been receiving it regularly and hope that it will keep on.

Lately, I have been eating excellent food, roast chicken twice a day.  It is young, soft chicken and always well cooked.  I was rationed some beer and Coca Cola (real Coca Cola).  The weather is simply beautiful.  The sea in front of me is calm and serene.

I feel that this is my rest before starting my voyage home.  I don’t think it will take long.  At the utmost, it will be a question of weeks.  I wish it were of days.  The outlook at the present is very bright and my morale is sky high.  I don’t see the day when I’ll say good bye to this island.  It will not be a sad farewell.  My heart will be overflowing with joy, knowing that within a few days, I’ll be able to have you in my arms.

I send you loads and loads of kisses while I’m waiting.

											I do love you,

My darling Annette,

I’m curious to know if you got any mail from me on or around your birthday.  I’ll know soon.  I wish and hope that you did.

I’m sweating my turn to come home.  I know I’ll be on the way soon, but don’t know when.  The transportation problem is a serious one.  I am feverishly waiting for a green light, for the beginning of my trip toward home and you.  Within a few days, I’ll start my fortieth month overseas.  I hope I’ll be on my way by then.  I feel cheerful nowadays.  I am all imbued in my coming home idea.  I should be home some time in August.  Wouldn’t it be wonderful to have part of August and part of September reserved to ourselves, to do as we please, to go where our hearts desire, and for once to be free and together?

I can’t complain about my daily life.  I am left to myself.  I take care of the sick call and an occasional patient during the day.  I dedicate the rest of the day to reading and walking.  The food has been excellent.  I had three fresh eggs for breakfast.  I had chicken six times this week.  I’m not restricted to the camp area.  I can go where I please.

Life in this part of the Philippines is returning rapidly toward normalcy.  I can take a jeep ride any time I desire.  The roads are good.  Some are paved and most of them stretch along the seashore.  I have two jeeps at my disposition.  It only requires a telephone call to have a jeep in front of my tent.  There are more than a dozen open-air movie theaters in this area.  My only problem is to choose which is the best.

Yes, I think it will be grand for me to come home in the summer.  I will adapt myself much easier to the cold climate.  I have lived in summer weather for more than three years.  It’s a very long summer!

Today, it’s raining, not bad.  It’s a slow rain, a few lazy drops are falling.  The sea is calm, lead-colored.  It’s not cold.  It’s not hot.  It’s comfortable.

Do you know that it seems incredible that my turn to come home is getting nearer and nearer every day?  I’ve been waiting for it so long.  I have wished for it so many million times!

Have many and many kisses.

											I do love you.

My darling Annette,

I’m getting worried about your health.  I’ve been putting together a few bits of information that I gathered from your letters and from those I got from Dad.  He writes that you have lost a lot of weight.  Your picture confirms your statement that your weight is getting lower and lower.  Are you sure that you are doing the right thing?  Are you starving yourself or are you sick?  If you don’t feel well, darling, do not wait for me, but go and see a doctor.  I guess that you already consulted one.  Your blood pressure is low, not to cause worry, however.  But, it should not go any lower.  How are you feeling?  Are you hiding anything from me?  I like to know if you don’t feel well, darling.  I love you.  Your well being is as important to my happiness as is my own.  When your body suffers, I suffer.  I enjoy and feel well when you enjoy and feel well.  But I’m worried.  Please, darling, do not by any means try to lose any more weight.  See if you can regain a few pounds.  

I’m trying to put on some weight.  I want to be in good shape by the time I come home.  I am going to love you day and night and want to be in the best shape to do it.  I have, we have to regain all the time we lost.

I include here a picture that I took on the east coast of Palawan during the middle of the month of March.  I am standing in the middle row at the right.  I am thrusting my helmet in the air with my right hand.  The natives are brandishing their bolos in the air and crying “Long Live the Philippines.”  That mottled crew constitutes the cream of the criminals of the Philippine Islands.  They are so bad that the Japanese never bothered to see them.  They are inmates of a penal colony.  They came with us as carriers.  They were good fellows because they knew that they did not have a chance with us.  They looked up at us.  I, being a doctor and having given medical care to some of them, was respected and obeyed.  All of them are serving for ten years to life imprisonment.  They have committed every kind of crime.  Some are thieves, others murderers, others rapists, etc.

From my letters, you already concluded that I was in Zamboanga.   Yes, I am in Zamboanga.  I landed here on March 21.  Before that, I was at Palawan.  I hope that this will be my last domicile in the Philippines.

I love you.  Have many and many kisses.

My darling Annette,

Your letter of July 8 is lovely.  It made my heart feel good.  I was down in the dumps.  This transportation and these men that are supposed to relieve me are not coming.  I’m waiting and hoping and hoping some more.  Funny that my feeling has been wrong lately.  I felt sure that I’d be home by now.  As you see, I’m still here, in the same place by the seashore among the coconuts.  At the present, a cool, soft, gentle, caressing breeze is blowing.  This would be an ideal place for you and me to pass the rest of our honeymoon.  However, I know that we can find a place as good as this in old Uncle Sam country.  Don’t you think so?

I’m feeling well.  There is nothing to do here but go to the movies and look at the scenery and dream and love you in my daydreams and night dreams.

I can’t tell you how much I love you.  I do love you so much that it hurts.  Have all my kisses.

											I do love you.

My darling wife,

I’m very sorry to have to disappoint you, to have you waiting daily for me while I’m still here in the Philippines.  I was so darned sure that by now I would be on my way home or maybe home!  But as you see from the date, I’m still here and don’t know when transportation will be available.  Things change so suddenly from one direction to another that my head keeps spinning around and around.  The change in morale is so great, the variations between a state of elation and well-being and mental depression are so great that I wonder how a man can stand it and live through it.

I’ve been dreaming of picnics, of love, of summer nights, of swimming trips, of good times ahead!  Yesterday, I thought they were within reach.  Today, I’m not so sure.  Today, I’m anxiously waiting and sweating it out, as we used to say.

Do not worry, darling.  I’m all right.  Your husband can take it when anybody else can’t.

I really expect to be on my way soon.  It may be a week or more weeks.  It all depends on circumstances beyond my control.  The war is turning rapidly toward a sudden end and all men will be home, maybe before I can imagine.

I’m carrying on as usual.  I may soon be transferred to a hospital to work as a doctor until I’ll be sent home.  My days of fighting and foxholes are over.  Recently, I have been thanked for the good work I have done by the Division Surgeon.

I keep myself busy reading, doing my work, seeing movies and complaining, always complaining, because I’m kept overseas so long, much more beyond the duty of the average American soldier.  Tomorrow morning, I start my fortieth month overseas.  Incredible!  I thought I could never survive such a long time overseas.  I am now going on my twenty-third month in the combat zone.

What do they ask of me?  My skin?  Haven’t I done more than is required of me?  I heard from the news broadcasts that the Army is going to discharge 7,000 medical officers by May, 1946.  I have the highest points and should be included in that number.  It’s only fair, don’t you think?  I’m waiting to be sent home and have you in my arms and love you.


									I am yours, body and soul.

My darling Annette,

Yesterday, I left the 186th Infantry Regiment and was transferred to the 116th Medical Battalion, D Company.  I had been in the 186th Infantry for forty months.  I was one of the few remaining officers of the originals who came overseas with the Division.  I asked to be transferred to this Company D, a hospital unit that has eight doctors.  All the officers are doctors.  It did not take long to change.  

I asked to be transferred when I saw that my chances to come home at present, at least, are nil.  Don’t be surprised, darling.  This is the Army.  I don’t tell you what I think about it, nor what I feel.  It’s better that I do not write my thoughts.  Just consider for a second.  I saw the Division Surgeon and asked him how I stood on the list of the officers who have enough points for going home.  He told me that I was one of the highest and that my name was on the July list.  So, officially and definitely, I was supposed to come home in July.  Henceforth, my high hopes, my planning, my dreaming, my high morale.  The whole world looked rosy and beautiful.  I was happy in expectancy.  I was floating in the clouds, moving with the moon in an ethereal world of dreams and happiness.

Then, it happened again.  An order came down from higher authorities that no doctors will go home for the time being, or rather for an indefinite period of time.  I can’t understand it.  In the States, they are discharging doctors from the Armed Forces.  Here they don’t have enough doctors!  What kind of a world is this?  Am I fighting for justice, humanity, and the pursuit of happiness or am I a machine or tool that can be abused at will?  

I am sorry for you, darling.  I have given and caused you more suffering than happiness.  I can’t tell you how I felt when I heard that I was not coming home for an indefinite time.  At first, I could not believe it.  I thought that the men who were telling me that I was not going home were just kidding.  But, too many people think and say that nobody is going home.  I don’t know what to do.  

Even though here it’s better than where I was (I am with professional people and in a hospital unit), I’m not happy.  I was all set to come home and that is all I want to do.  For the present, I am undecided as to what course I’ll take.  I guess my best bet is to stick around for a while at least and see how things are going.  

I’m tired of soldiering.  I’m tired of combat.  I’m tired of overseas duty.  I’m tired of the Pacific Ocean and all its islands.  I’m tired of blue sky and blue waters.  I want a change.  I need a change.  It is imperative for me to get a change.  I promise you that I’m going to get it.

I’m very sorry, darling, to disappoint you again.  It was and still is a shock for me. 

I saw a picture last night “The Clock.”  I liked it.

Darling, have all my love until I see you again.  Have all my love and many kisses.

											I am yours,

My darling Annette,

August will come, but my promises will not be realized.  I will still be here.  I’ll still be in this forsaken part of the world with no hope to come home at present.  A month ago, everything looked bright and promising.  We were told definitely that our time was limited.  I read it in black and white.  Now, at present, I have no hope to come home.  If I had the power, I would take you out of this world and then take the whole world and smash and crush it in my hands.  

I am cynical about freedom and human rights.  I am cynical about everything.  I don’t know how long it will last.  I am deeply sorry for you.  I have caused you so many disappointments.  This is my greatest disappointment.  This is the worst blow I ever suffered.  I’m so tired of this war, this soldiering, this overseas life and everything that goes with it.  What makes me bitter is the fact that I have given more than the average individual, that I have sacrificed more than the average American will ever sacrifice, and that I don’t see the end of duty.  I have been giving, giving, always giving without receiving any compensation.   Have I only duties and not ONE right?  Am I not a human being?

The point system is a farce as far as the officers are concerned, especially the medical officers.  The glamour boys don’t have any guts to do anything without the help of the medical officers.

I am not the only one, but there are not many in my condition.  We are only half a dozen.  I’m a little bit better off where I am now than where I was.  I’m with a hospital company.  We have tents, cots and many sick people to take care of.  I feel I’m a doctor and am doing some medicine.  I have been reading a lot of medicine.  This has kept my mind out of trouble and relieved my worries and restlessness.

Last night, I saw a good picture “ A Royal Scandal.”   I don’t know if you saw it.  I recommend it.  It helped me to forget my present condition and relax my nervous tension.  The diction and acting were excellent.  The comedy is studded with jokes and jabs and stabs.  I enjoyed it and felt much better after I saw it.

I’m going to stay here for a while at least.  I’m going to wait to see what is going to happen.  I am one of the highest on the list and if there is going to be any change in policy, I’ll be sent home.  This is the only ray of hope that keeps me going.  

I want so much to come home and be with you that I would be ready to do anything.  Forty months of separation is the nearest thing to hell I ever experienced.
I love you, darling.  I love you so much and so deeply.

						I am all yours,				Silvio

My darling Annette,

It’s early Monday morning.  I’ve already taken care of my morning chores, the first ones.  I’m waiting for some more work.  As I told you, I’m in a field hospital.  I’m doing the same work I did when forty odd months ago, I was transferred to the 186th Infantry.   It’s a change, a very welcome one.  It came at the right time.  Otherwise, I would have turned in as a psycho-neurotic.  My mind is occupied most of the day.  I’m reading a lot of medical literature.  I experience a pleasure similar to that one feels when he returns to accustomed and familiar places.  I enjoy refreshing my memory of medical knowledge.  I see a lot of patients.  All this helps me, keeping my mind away from my deep, strong, unsatisfied, eternal desire to come home and be with you.  

My return home seemed to be so near at hand a couple of weeks ago.  Now I wonder how I am where I was a few months ago and now I hope and pray and curse from the depths of my being at this human injustice.  Am I so important, am I so essential to the war effort against Japan that the Army cannot afford my release?  I resent it bitterly.  I always resisted and fought injustice.  I think that this is unjust, inhuman, and tyrannical.

I thought it was my duty to come overseas and give my help.  I thought it was necessary to risk my life to help in the war effort.  I have given my whole hearted cooperation.  I never shrank from any hazardous duty.  I never spared myself when it came to snatch a human life from the greedy clutches of death.  And what do I get as a compensation?  More duty, more responsibility.  I’m tired of the whole thing!  It is true that the war is going on satisfactorily.  It is true that it will be over before we expected.  Then, why do they keep us here?  Why am I essential?  Why not give a chance to other men to take my place and I’ll take theirs?

This is how I feel at present.  I’m going to wait and see.  I’m going to see what they decide.  I’ll wait for a few weeks, maybe a month.  I expect a change next month or later.  It’s bound to be.  I expect the medical officers who served in Europe to come to relieve us.  If no relief will be in sight, I ‘m going to come home through the hospital.  I’ll get sick somehow.  I’ll get sick without any feeling of remorse, of shirking my duty.  I have done more than my share in winning this war.  It’s time for me to pay the moral obligation I’m indebted to my family, to you.  It’s not human, nor fair, to keep you waiting year after year.  Forty months is a long time when it is taken away from the best years of our lives.

Don’t be discouraged, darling.  We will survive this ordeal.  Our happy days will not be far away.  I am thankful and grateful that I have your love and that no power on earth or combination of powers will ever destroy it.  I love you dearly, deeply, and eternally.

											I’m yours,

My darling Annette,

You have a well-deserved right to complain because I did not write for a few days at the beginning of this month.  I think I have a plausible excuse.  I procrastinated from day to day, hoping that the next day would bring the news that I was expecting for 39 months, the news that I would go home.  The news never came.  You know, darling, that even though I don’t write, I am always thinking and dreaming of you.  Those were trying days of waiting, exasperating, nerve-racking waiting.

I’m glad I have changed place.  Here all the officers are “old men” who have been with the Division since it came overseas and have gone through hell during the last three years.  All have wives at home, all are eager to get home.  We have a lot in common.  We even joke about our hospital staff.  We call it the “Old Folks Home.”  We are the FEW WHO HAVE DONE OUR PART.  

I am going to try to explain to you the dilemma I am in.  At present, all the doctors have been declared essential.  In other words, the war against Japan can’t go on unless I stay overseas.  I never thought that I was so essential.  I have two choices.  I go to the hospital as a psycho-neurotic and after going through many hospitals, I MAY be sent home.  This is a way out, though not an honorable one.  I have been overseas so long and have done my duty with distinction and honor.  I want to go home, to come home with honor and with my conscience clear and unsoiled.  The other way is to wait and hope.  As you know, I’m healthy.  I have not lost one day since I came into the Army.  I can only get out by playing the part of a “psycho” or “nut.”  I disdain it.  I prefer to wait for a while at least.  

What do you think?  I’d like to know your opinion.  I think if I wait for a while, I may get a break.  I expect it as soon as the troops from Europe are redeployed to the Pacific.  Maybe the war will be over before long.  Do not complain, darling.  There are still some men who have been overseas longer than I have.  Some have 140 points and are still here!  I’d like to know your opinion.  Meanwhile, I’d better wait.  

I do a lot of reading, especially medical books.  I’m refreshing my mind and preparing myself for my civilian life.  This war will not last forever.  

Have, my beloved Annette, many and many kisses.  I do love you with all my heart and more than anything else in the whole wide world.

										I am all yours,
										Silvio

P.S.	I include a $100.money order.

My darling Annette,

Another month is coming to an end.  Another month is ending without seeing me pack and run home toward you and happiness.  I’m still in Zamboanga and will be here for I don’t know how long.  I hope until I start for home.

The climate is hot.  It has not rained for quite a while.  Even the weather is against us.  While I was in contact with the enemy, it rained very often and I was soaked and wet nearly every day.  Now that I have tents to cover me and no walking or moving around to do, it does not rain.  The days are sunny and the nights are starry.  There is a beautiful moon out every night.  The beauty of nature and the peaceful surroundings should enhance my spirit and spur noble thoughts, but my goodness!  I am getting bitter and disgusted.  The inequities of mankind and of those in responsible positions change and transform the beauty of nature into a gloomy picture.

As I said, I’ll be waiting.  What do you think I should do?  Stay here and take it or get out by honorable or dishonorable discharge?

It’s early morning.  These thoughts are with me all the time.  I want to come home.  I would do anything to come home, even...


											I love you.

My darling Annette,

I’m including another $100. money order.  I sent you another a couple of days ago.  I had been saving and accumulating money since last Christmas.  I wanted to come home with a lot of money in my pocketbook to be able to buy you a good present and to have money ready to spend for a vacation.  As my hopes to come home at present are slim (No medical officer has left during the past two months and I wonder if any will leave this current month), I’m sending a few hundred dollars I have been carrying with me for months.  In my next letter, I’ll send you another money order of the same amount.

It appears to me that the Army does not leave anything else to do but save money.  These days are very trying for me.  It’s impossible for me to adapt my thoughts to the idea that I must remain overseas for an indefinite period of time.  I still believe and hope that I will soon leave for home.  I fool myself into believing that the policy will soon change and I’ll be on my way home.  It causes me great grief and vexations to know that I caused you so much and so many disappointments.  It hurts me. 

I’m always thinking of you.  I love you, darling.  

									Have kisses and kisses.

My darling Annette,

I have been doing some computing today.  Tomorrow, we’ll be married three years and a half.  We have been married 182 weeks.  We were together ten weeks and nearly one half.  We have been together one week out of eighteen.  One week for us and seventeen for Uncle Sam.  I don’t know what you would call Uncle Sam.  I have been calling him many names and some of them are not in the dictionary.

Don’t think that I’m the worst off.  There are officers who have forty points more than I have and are still here waiting.  This does not alleviate our and especially my situation.  I feel, darling, that I have done my part.  I have been pushing Japs from Port Moresby to Luzon, from the fall of 1942 to the summer of 1945.  I’ve done my share of the duty and should be sent home according to any human and common sense standard.

I feel that I have contributed more than my share.  I feel that I have the right and duty toward my family to come back home and get children of my own.  Yes, have children of our own who may enjoy in the future the fruits of our sacrifices.  What is the use to sacrifice so much and the best years of our lives without ripening any fruit?  What’s the use to build and accumulate a right unless I have a chance to enjoy it?

I am going to wait for a few more weeks, but if I don’t see any green light, if I’m convinced beyond any doubt that I’m going to be kept here for the duration and more, I’ll get so mad that nobody will be able to keep me.  Or if they keep me, I’ll be so mad that I’ll be useless.

I’m getting tired, very tired of this life.  I need a change.  I feel that I must have a change.  It is true that I’m physically speaking in good shape, but I am deteriorating mentally.  Twenty-three months in combat zones and the experiences of many campaigns and the innumerable dangers and chances and the many times when death was only a few inches from me are enough to wear down any man.  I’m surprised at myself that I have so much stamina.  I must be thankful to my parents who gave me a perfect body.

How are you, darling?  Oh, how I wish I could come home!  I want to come home more than anything else in the world.  I need you, I need your company, I need your love.

I include another money order of $100.  This is my third and last one for a while.  I hope you’ll receive them all.  Please let me know.

Have a million kisses and all my love.

						I’m all yours,					Silvio

My darling Annette,

I started to write you a letter early this morning.  I had to stop half way through.  My morale was so low and my words so bitter that I had to stop, disgusted at myself.

Today, I received the letter you wrote while you were waiting for your friends, Oliva and Med, to wake up.

The light went out.  I stopped writing and went to the movies to see “Without Love” with Tracy and Hepburn.  I enjoyed it.  It’s a comedy full of wit and hilarity.

As I was telling you, my morale was very low.  This waiting, this indecision exasperates me.  But, the “atomic bomb” and the valiant Russian entry into the Pacific War has lifted my morale, has given me hope of a quick end of the war and my secured return home.  

I don’t know why the Japs don’t give up.  They have as much chance to win the war as I have to fly to the moon.  I don’t expect them to resist long, a month at the most.

I received the happy news that my brother John is alive and in good condition.  That was a great load off my chest.  John is my greatest pal.

I have to go and work now.  Have all my love.  Hoping to send you good news soon.  I send you all my love.

										I’m all yours,

My darling Annette,

The last few days have been crowded with so many fateful events that they have made me temporarily forget my personal grievances.

First, I received a letter from Dad telling me that my brother John is alive and thriving.  Next, I heard that the Russians had entered into the war against Japan and the announcement of the atomic bomb.  Last, I heard the Japanese had offered to surrender.  All of these news have been wonderful.  Each one helped to raise my morale, each helped to enhance and foster my hope of a quick return to you.  My morale was very low, the lowest I ever had.

I was sitting alone in my tent and listening to a music program when an announcement was made.  The music stopped and the announcer said in a clear and excited voice that the Jap government had offered to surrender.  I could not believe my ears!  I got so excited that I screamed, ran out of my tent, and called the attention of the officers.  In a few minutes, everybody was howling and screaming.  A Fourth of July celebration started and went on into the night.

I am feeling very well now.  My hopes are sky high.  This is the third time I experienced such emotion.  It’s the third time in a period of four months.  I expect the fighting to be over soon.  I expect to be sent home shortly or be on my way home.

My happiness is tempered by the feeling that I had to disappoint you.  You are waiting for me to be home any day and I’m still here.  You understand that I hate to have you disappointed so many times.  But I promise I’ll be home soon.  

We’d better start planning about our future.  I don’t know what to do.  I think that I should go back to a hospital for a few months before I go back to private practice.  I am undecided about what to do.  Would you like to inquire and see if they have an opening for me at St. Joseph’s Hospital?  Can you ask Uncle?  I wouldn’t mind staying in Lowell for a few months before starting out on my own.

We have saved enough money to keep us going for a long time.  We deserve to enjoy it together.  

I don’t see the day to be back with you, to love you, to be with you.

											I love you.

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

The war is over!  The guns of the armies of the world will be silent today.  Yes, the war is over.  At last it’s over.  I am no longer essential.  I expect to be sent home at any time now.  These last few months have been terrible for me.  They have given me more suffering and anguish than a hard campaign.  I had to hope to be with you for a long time and had a hard time to bear such a life and thoughts.

But, now I have hope, now I know that I am going home, that I’m coming to you in a matter of weeks or maybe less.  Nothing can keep me back now.  I expect that soon the restrictions will be released and I’ll start my way back home.  I’ll travel through peaceful waters, unafraid of submarines!

Finally, the war is over and at what a cost!  You and I have paid a very high price in sacrifices.  We can call this war our war and this victory our victory and this America our America.

There has been an interruption of four hours.  I was called to perform some work, took care of a few sick people, and discussed my probabilities about going home soon.

My morale is sky high again. Everything points toward my release from the service and my chances of going home.

I’m back to where I left off four weeks ago.  I’m back to my dreaming.  I’m happily dreaming again.  I’m out in the free air, happy and glad that everything is over.  I’m out of the gloomy days of despair and hopelessness and deeply felt bitterness and injustice.  Everything looks brighter.  Even Zamboanga has become a fair place to wait (I don’t say to live) before coming home.

I’m not going to make any plans about my discharge and what I’ll do after I am a civilian.  I have a few ideas.  I may try to stay in a civilian hospital for a while or go directly into private practice.  I want to come home and go around and see things for myself.  In the meantime, if you can gather bits of information that may help me, so much the better.

It will not be long now, darling, before we will be in each other’s arms and in a world at peace.  

I’m all yours and I do love you very, very much.

My darling Annette,

I received your letter of August 6.  I was curious and anxious to see how you reacted to my gloomy letter.  It was a bitter shock to you as it was to me.  I’m glad, however, that you did not suffer as long as I did.  Your black days were few.  The news was good starting August 9 and got better and better every day.  I know that you received the news of the end of the Japanese war with as much enthusiasm as I did.  

I don’t know how long I’ll remain here. I have a feeling that it will not be long.  I’m now waiting impatiently for a definite policy.  The war being over, I’m not needed as much as I was a week ago.  I expect that the War Department will relax the restrictions on medical officers and I will be sent home for good.  I’ll know definitely in two weeks.  I may still be home by September.  If I’m chosen for September, I may get home by the end of the month and still be in time to enjoy the glorious New England fall.  It will not be so hot and we will have a lot of fun.

I am still with the 116th Medical Battalion and in D Company.  D Company is a hospital company.  We have doctors and patients.  We take care of all the soldiers who get sick and will be in the hospital for a period of five to ten days.  It’s a field hospital with accommodations of up to 200 beds.  It’s a movable hospital.  We can close it in a short time and move to another place at a moment’s notice.  We are part of the 41st Division and go wherever the Division goes.  We are the only hospital unit that does not have any female nurses.  The female nurses are not attached to any division.  They have never been and never will be.

So, don’t worry, darling.  There is no danger that I will be inveigled by the charms of a nurse.  I don’t have the opportunity.  Moreover, if there were any nurses around, I would not have a chance.  The Air Force officers are the glamour boys and no medical man has a chance to compete with them.  Moreover, I love my wife and am proud to be married and let it be known to anybody, be it male or female.  

I married the girl of my dreams, the girl I loved and love so much.  I feel and know and think that I married the best girl in the whole world and that there is no other girl in the whole world who can come up to her.  I love her and have been preserving all my love for her and her alone.  I’ll show you when I come home how much I love you.  I’ll make so much love to you and I’ll stick by you so much and so long that you’ll have a hard time to get a respite to breathe.  I’ve always been yours and only yours and I’ll be yours all my life.  I love you deeply, madly, and forever.  Yes, I’ll be yours, always and forever.

Have my heartfelt kisses and all my love.

My darling Annette,

Today, I start my forty-first month of overseas duty.  I’ll not ask how many more or how long I’ll be kept overseas with a feeling of irritation and impatience.  The war is definitely over except for small skirmishes and I’ll be on my way home in a peaceful world that our sacrifices, however small and puny compared to others, have helped to achieve.

I don’t think it will be long before I leave for home.  If worst comes to worst, I don’t think I’ll be overseas longer than a couple of months or around that.  I expect to be sent home soon and even discharged from the Army.  

I’d like to work in a civilian hospital for a few months before going into private practice.  But, before thinking of any engagements, I want to be free from any duty or obligation, free to be with you and take you wherever our hearts desire.  I have only one plan about our vacation.  I want to be with you and you alone.

Your letter of August 9 gave me great pleasure.  It’s one of the best letters you ever wrote.  It’s grand and noble.  I’m mighty proud of you.  It proves to me that even though we have been separated for so long, our hearts and minds fully and wholly understand one another and compensate each other.  You are wonderful, darling.

I’m in the same place.  The end of the war has soothed my nervous tension and I feel more hopeful and relaxed.  I don’t expect to remain here for very long.  The next move I’ll make will be in the direction of home.

I’m doing the same work.  I do some reading, though the excessive heat makes me sleepy during the noon hours.  It’s warmer now than it has ever been before on this island.

This afternoon, I went for a swim.  The beach is only a couple of hundred yards from my tent.  The water is warm and not too refreshing.  I was as warm when I came out as I was when I went into the water.  

I received a letter from Dad telling me about John.  I am very happy that he’s alive and healthy.  I was worried about him.  He is my best friend and pal.  Maybe you and I will take a trip to Italy to pay him a visit.  How do you like the idea?

How is your mother?  Auntie?  Uncle?  Give them my best regards.
Wouldn’t it be lovely if I could be home during the fall?  I love New England’s fall!

Have many and many kisses.

My darling and beloved wife,

Here I am.  It’s Saturday evening.  I had supper about an hour ago.  I’m back in my tent, writing on a rickety table while the radio is playing.  This is a local Army station that plays records a few hours every day and transmits the news from the States every hour on the hour.  Most of the records are popular radio broadcasts that you can hear every night at home like Eddie Cantor, Ray Smith, etc.  Occasionally, I hear a symphony or an opera duet.

This hour is the most pleasant one.  The sun is lowering down on the horizon.  The temperature is not too hot, not too cool.  There is a soft breeze.  The men are playing baseball and scream and howl as they do at home.  This should be a good hour and a good time to relax and commune with nature and the beauty of the hour.  During the warm hours of the day, the excessive heat keeps my brain and mind in a state of torpor.  My feelings, emotions, and reasoning power are dulled.  Now my mind is getting clearer.
The cool breeze dispels the fog.  I should relax, rest, and be pleased with myself.  But, on the contrary, I get restless, irritated, and feel bitter.  I feel bitter against everybody.   This life is getting my goat.  I don’t think I can stand it much longer.

My life here would be wonderful if you were with me.  The nights are everything a lover could ask for, but for a lonesome man who misses his wife so much, these wonderful evenings and romantic nights are exasperating.  They make me more lonesome, more miserable.  They make me miss you more and more.  I love you, darling.  I love you so much that I feel my heart aching.  I want you.  I need you.  I want to kiss you so much.  I want to keep you in my arms, to kiss you, to love you.  That day when we’ll meet again will come soon, I hope very soon.  I have been waiting so long!

At present, I’m waiting.  I’m waiting patiently with hope.  There are so many rumors floating around that it’s hard to believe any.  They are all good rumors.  I don’t think they’ll keep me here any longer.  I’ve done my part.  I don’t belong here any more.

I count the days, one after another.  Every day I say: one less to go.  Yes, there is always one less to go.  Every day there is one less to go until that day when we’ll meet again and start to live again.

I love you.

											I’m all yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

The radio is playing “Dream When You are Blue.”  It’s a sweet song full of feeling.  I have dreamed so much and so long that I wish my dreams would come true soon.  I’m still waiting, some days patiently, some days indignantly.  Within a few days, I should know how I stand.  

All is quiet now.  Only the rumors have a holiday and a booming business.  I expect to be sent home soon and I feel that I will not disappoint you again.  I’ll soon be on my way home.  I’ll write you as soon as I know.  Air mail letters travel faster than telegrams.  I don’t see the day when I’ll be able to kiss you.

I received your bank account today.  I can’t imagine nor figure how you could have saved more than you did.  Thanks to you, we’ll have a good bank account to start our life together.  You are wonderful.

Don’t worry about a job.  Take it easy.  I’ll be home before your unemployment insurance will come to an end.  You can take it easy now.  You don’t have to worry about me.  The war is over and there is no danger for me.  This is a great relief and you can relax.  I will be home in a short time, darling.

I love you with all my heart.

My darling Annette,

You are tired of looking at the Zamboanga on the date line.  I’m tired of writing it.  I’m getting tired of living in it.  I landed here five months ago yesterday, moved up to the hills and made contact with the enemy, and followed him for three weeks.  I had a month’s rest, then moved again, made another landing fifty miles up the coast, moved through mud, climbed hills, forded rivers and saw more and more dead Japs.

Here, all is quiet.  There is no tension, no apprehension about what tomorrow has in store.  The war is over and Japan is invaded.  I have done my part.  I’m not needed any more and should be sent home in the near future.  How many times have I said the same words or expressed the same thought?  How many more times shall I repeat it?

I’m waiting patiently.  I know that I’m coming home someday in the near future.  You’d better start massaging your lips because I’m going to kiss them so many times that they may get sore!

I’m feeling well, putting on a few pounds.  I have a swim every afternoon.  I am all right, but for this waiting and waiting to be sent home.

I love you very, very much.


										I’m yours,

										Silvio
