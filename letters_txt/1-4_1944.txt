My darling wife,

These are the first words I am writing this new year.  I slept from 1943 into 1944.  After I wrote my previous letter last year, I went to see a movie a couple of hundred yards from my tent, then went to bed and slept until the first dawn of 1944 appeared in the tent.  I worked yesterday.  I was busy all day.  When I came back to my tent, it was dark and I had to procrastinate my writing to you until this morning.

I am taking it easy today.  It’s a lovely day, full of sunlight.  A great day to pass at the beach with you.  Instead, I’ll be hanging around here, reading the paper, chatting, killing time until night falls.  As usual, I cannot tell you what I am doing or where I am.  Don’t worry!  I am all right.  I feel fine.  I am not complaining about things in general.  As time goes by, I am looking forward to the day when I’ll reach the United States shores and be home with you.

From the radio and newspapers I am receiving, I am reading very encouraging news.  The war will not be over soon, but we are definitely on the way to victory.  It is not like a year ago when we were wondering if we were going to win or lose the war.  Things were black on all fronts then.  Now the question before me is of time.  It is a question of time when the war will end with the United Nations victorious.

For myself, I nourish a great hope.  I hope to be able to come home, even before the war is over.  I hope to come home this year, 1944.  

I wish you during this year the best luck in the world.  For myself, I wish one thing only: to come back home during this coming twelve months.

I don’t know what happened to the mail.  It’s been scarce recently.

During this year, I’ll be loving you and thinking of you.  Many, many kisses every single day of its 365 days.

Have hundreds and thousands of kisses and a big, long one as a special New Year’s Day kiss.

I do love and adore you.

							I am all yours body and soul,


							Silvio

My darling Annette,

Today it is a week since I received your last letter.  I have been living outside the camp for a few days.  When I came back yesterday morning, I had great hope to read one of your sweet letters fresh from you.  But no, there was no mail for me.

How are you, darling?  I have not received any news from you since you left work.  I am anxious to know how you are.  These long days with no mail from you plus the news that I read in the papers that an epidemic of influenza is widespread in New England make me worry a great deal.  A letter from you now would make me the happiest man in the world.  I would cherish it more than anything else in the world and second only to the hope of coming home someday.

How are you, my darling wife?  Did the cold get you?  In times like these, I would like to be home to look after you.  You know how well I would take care of you.

Soon, we will be married for two years.  It looks as if we must be apart even on our second anniversary!  I have been looking forward to it, but I have to bow to superior power even against my heart’s desire.  Last year, even though I was in New Guinea, I celebrated our first anniversary.  I was still all flushed by my recent promotion.  I wonder what I’ll do in Australia this year.

I can’t stop worrying.  Last year, you sent me a telegram for Christmas.  I sent you one this year.  I have not received one from you.  I wish the mail would be more efficient.  During the holidays, it has been very poor.  I had the worst holidays since I have been in the Army and I can truly say since I can remember.  I don’t blame anybody for it.  I know it’s my duty and would not mind making any sacrifice if only I had a hope to come home soon.

It’s a warm, sunny day.  The breeze is blowing gently as usual.  It makes a sultry day bearable.

I am feeling well.  I have not lost any weight even though I have had a hard time recently and have not been in very comfortable surroundings.  I hope now when I reach my old camp that I’ll get news from you.

I can’t tell you how much I love you, my darling, and how much I wish I could come home and be with you forever.

I love you and adore you.

										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

A few hours ago, I rode into my base camp where I have been for nearly one year and a half except for the period that I was in New Guinea.  I am tired from the overnight trip.  As I told you previously, these trains are everything but comfortable.  Moreover, the mosquitoes saw to it.  They made my trip not only tiresome but also painful.  I awoke at about 2:30 A.M. feeling a stinging pain around my wrists and neck.  I went to see myself in the mirror and found my skin studded with welts caused by the bites of the mosquitoes. 

I was anxious to be back.  The first thing I did was to look for mail.  I was certain that I would find some from you.  When I was told that I had none, I felt bad.  It hurt me.  The last letter I received from you was written a month ago today.  The last letter I received from Dad was written a month ago tomorrow.

I hope the fault is due to the mail service, but I am anxious and worried.  I don’t know why, but I am afraid that you are sick with the flu and so are my folks.

I curse this d_____ war and the d_____ Japs that caused it! 

I have no idea how you passed your Christmas and New Year’s holidays.

I’ll be waiting anxiously daily for your letter, for your first letter this year.

I hope I’ll get some rest for a while now.  I had a tough month.

I am thinking and dreaming of you.

I love and adore you.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

This noon, I received your first letter of 1944.  It was a relief to see your handwriting on the envelope again.  I hadn’t received any mail from you for two weeks and was worried.  I tried to console myself by rationalizing and finding excuses such as that the mail is slow during the Christmas holidays, but to no avail.   It hurt me every time mail came in and I had none.  But today it’s my day.  I got two letters today, one of December 17 and one of December 22.

I am glad you are enjoying your rest.  I think you deserve it.  How is your headache?  Is it better?  I hope it’s gone.

I am glad you got a thrill out of my record.  I agree with you about some needed improvement.  I am going to work at it as soon as I have time available.  

I think you are right.  Do not sell your house.  Just consider for a second.  If you sell it and collect $3800. what do you do with the money?  You put it in a bank at 2% interest.  You’ll receive $76. interest a year.  It doesn’t pay when you consider that you must rent an apartment or another house.  This will cost at least $40. or $50. per month even in Lowell nowadays.  Make it $40. per month.  So, it would cost $480. per year for rent only.  If I remember correctly, you used to pay $10. per month in taxes.  Add to it the water bill and the devaluation of the house.  Your house is old and does not deteriorate much in a year.  In my opinion, by keeping your house, you not only have a place dear   to your memories and mine (There is not a room in it in which we do not have something to remember), but you also save from $15. to $25 a month or from $180. to $300. a year.

I’m sorry you did not receive the sheepskin rug.  It should have been in Lowell by Christmas or soon after.  I am sure you’ll get it unless the Japs got it, but I don’t think so.

As I told you in my previous letter, I just came back from a month spent at the beach.  It was not a vacation by any means.  I cannot tell you what I did or learned.  I can’t tell you.  I am glad it’s over and that I’m back to this old place.  I have been here for a year and a half.

I think and feel that I have a chance to be sent back to the States this year.  As the time goes by, my chances become better and better.  I wish I could be able to pass the next Christmas holidays in your company.  We deserve a break, don’t we, darling?

The war is going our way all around the world.  In a few months, not a year, the European war will be over and some time later, this war will come to an end.

But I want to be home, at least for a while, before the war is over.

I love you and am all yours.

My darling Annette,

At present, I cannot complain about the mail.  I received three letters a few minutes ago.  I got your telegram which reassured me and stopped me from worrying.  I believe I read all the letters you wrote me up to January 10.  It took a weight off my chest.  I have never been so long without receiving a letter from you.  Moreover, the papers were talking about the epidemic of flu in the states.  This made things worse.

I am all right now and very happy that you are enjoying yourself and that you feel much better regarding your pains, etc.  I am still in Australia and hope to stay here for some time.  It’s hot, but I am used to it and do not mind it.  I am feeling well.  I have put on a few pounds since you saw me (I mean in the picture).  I am taking it easy, at least as much as I can.

You are right.  Promotions in the Army are very slow.  Sleeter, for instance, has been a Captain for nearly three years and Chapman has been a Major for nearly four years.  I come after them.  I have only been in my present rank for a year.  So I cannot complain.  I don’t care for promotions.  I care for a trip home to see you.  I am willing to pay any price for a trip home.  

I am sorry for causing you to wake up at 11 P.M. to read a Christmas telegram.  I did not want it that way.  I hope you will excuse me.

Within a few days, eleven to be exact, it will be two years since we got married.  I am sorry I did not marry you before.  You made me the happiest man in the world.  I love you, darling, more and more every day.  I’ll be home someday and I’ll show you what I mean and how much I love you.  I have tried every way possible to come home, darling, for our second anniversary, but I am still here, hoping.

I wish you a happy second anniversary with the hope of being together during our third one.  On this occasion, I send you as many kisses as there are stars twinkling during a cloudless night and without a moon in the Australian sky.

I adore you and love you.



										All yours,

My darling Annette,

My morale has been raised sky high.  I am getting your mail regularly.  I have received all your letters.  Today I read the v-mail you wrote on January 22.  It came in nine days!  It’s very good.

I am very sorry about the sheepskin rug.  Not only did it cost me money, but also time and the inquiring.  I had chosen it from a group of a dozen.  It was a good one.  The d_____ Japs!  I have received all the packages you sent me.  I am using the cotton pajamas you sent me in November.  I like them.

Have you received the letter from Mrs. Taylor?  She is waiting for an answer and is kind of keen about it.  I saw her last Saturday and she asked me about you and if you had received her letter and the pictures.  

This coming Monday, it will be two years since our wedding.  I had hopes but they are all vanished.  They are going to send a few men home starting in March.  I was not lucky.  I lost.  I am waiting for next month (I am sorry, I meant February).  I may have better luck and be chosen for the April quota.  Anyhow, I now have a hope to go home.  I had none a month ago, except in case of sickness.  I want to come back healthy.

I am feeling well.  I eat well, sleep well.  This is our last month of summer.  Then the fall will be here with cooler days.

I pass my free time reading or playing.  Olson and I have been playing cribbage for weeks.  Last night, he won.  Today was my day.  I gave him a good beating.

Chaplain Reinke is no longer with us.  He was transferred to another unit and made a Captain.  I am glad.  He was a Lieutenant for four years!  He’s happy now.  We now have Chaplain Law from New York State.  He is a nice fellow.  I play pinochle with him and others and have fun.  He is a Presbyterian.

Will you thank your mother for the slippers?  I like them.  They fit me perfectly.  I wore them a couple of times.  I do not plan to wear them except when the weather is dry.  I don’t want to spoil them in the mud.

I wish I were back to two years ago at this time.  I had to study very hard then, but I could still find time to dream of our coming wedding.  When I come back, we have to start again where we left off.  We still have four months of honeymoon to pass.  I have a feeling that I’ll be able to come home before this year is over.  I don’t know when, but someday.

I am in a hurry to come back.  We lost so much time in fighting the Japs!

I wish I could send you a Valentine’s Day card.  You know you are my Valentine and always will be.

I love you, darling.

My darling Annette,

I’m glad you found a job in Lynn.  I know that they will find you all right.

However, I am not so keen about it.  I do not like the idea of commuting by car to and from Lynn every day by car.  I know the New England winter and its roads.  I saw and took care of too many accidents due to sleet and snow.  I personally do not like you to take that job during this month and March.  If you like to work, I don’t mind after April.  I think you deserve a rest.  You can work at home and improve your cooking.  I am looking forward to the luscious meals we will eat together when I come back.

Already, a group will leave within a few weeks.  It’s a good sign.  I hope it does keep on.  I hope that a larger number will have a chance to go home for a little while.  I really feel better already.  At least I have a hope now.  A month ago I had none.  And I am dreaming, dreaming at the dining table, dreaming while walking and in my sleep, dreaming of the days to come, dreaming of my arrival, of the good times ahead.  I have a feeling that we will be together a lot during our third year of marriage.  We deserve it.  We must get it.

I am feeling fine.  I have not had any moody days lately.  The hope of coming back home is keeping me going on.

Remember me to all.

I love you very, very much.

My darling Annette,

Two years ago, we were in Carlisle.  At this time, we were already married and getting ready to go to New York.  Funny that I celebrated our second anniversary on February 8 while you celebrate it on February 7!  I am a day ahead of you.  An entire, a complete year has passed without our being able to see one another!

I’ll be home next year.  I promise, even if I have to become a stowaway.  That is how I feel now.  I wish I were with you on this day to celebrate it, to remember it together.  These anniversaries make me very unhappy.  The thought of where I am and that of where I would like to be exasperates me.  I keep hoping...I hope that I’ll have a chance to come home in the future and be with you.  I need you and want to be with you.  I love you now more than I did two years ago.  I wish I could kiss you today and be able to love you today.

I love you immensely.  Have a special big kiss and a million others.

I am all yours forever.

My darling Annette,

Do you remember two years ago at Carlisle?  Our first few days of married life?  Was I happy!  I am glad I knew I was.  Look at where I am now!

I am sorry my mail was held up.  I have been writing to you regularly at least once a week.  You are right.  I should write more often and I promise you to write more often.

I have been in the same place, doing the same work, seeing the same people, breathing the same air.  I have been out in the bush for a few days.  The weather having been good, I did not mind it.

Last Sunday, I went to visit a gold mine.  It took me two hours to go through it.  I’ll tell you all about it when I come home.  The visit was very interesting and I enjoyed it.  It was something new.  I had never seen a mine before.  I did not know that they had to work so hard and so long to extricate the precious yellow metal from the mountains.  The gold is so minutely mixed with the sand and rock that it is impossible to detect it with the naked eye.  I wish I could describe the mine to you, but as usual the censor would not like it.  I’ll tell you when I come home.

I had some very hot days while you were suffering from the cold New England winter.  Today, it’s cool.  It has poured all night and during the day.

I don’t know how long I’ll be here, but I guess I’ll be here for a long while.  You should not worry about me now.  Our Army has learned how to fight and our men are not afraid of the yellow b_______. 

Darling, we have gone a long way long way during the last two years.  I’m as usual keeping track of the time I spent overseas.  One more week and it will be twenty-two months!  I am wondering how many months shall I be kept away from you?  Soon, they will start to send a few men home.  I say a few.  I am not lucky this time.  I hope for next time.  I would like to come home during the summer and get used slowly to the cold climate.  I have been living in the summer climate for more than two years!

I find myself often lost in a daydream.  I dream of my return home.  I love to dream about what we will do and where we will go.

Your v-mail letter reached me within 10 to 14 days.  I like to receive them even though they are so short.

Remember me to Mother and Auntie.
I love and adore you.						I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I wish I could be with you tomorrow on Valentine’s Day.  But I must be satisfied with dreaming what I would like to do.  Instead, I’ll be here treading through the Australian hills.  

Today it’s Sunday.  I’m taking it very easy.  I slept until late and have been daydreaming ever since.

Your v-mail letters reach me regularly within 10 to 14 days.  

I am well and healthy.  The climate is just made for me.  

Have a special kiss for Valentine’s Day and many more.

Life is carrying on as usual.  I have seen a couple of pictures during the week and played pinochle.


										I love you.

My darling wife,

All the letters that you wrote between January 27 and February 5 reached me yesterday and today.  I received most of them last night at dusk soon after supper.  I had enough daylight to read them all.  I had to read the last one under the tent because of minute, silent rain.  I am sorry you have not received my mail regularly.  I have written you as usual every five or six days.  I may have skipped a couple of days because I was pleased and satisfied to know that you are well and that you love me.

No, darling, I did not stop loving you, not even for a little while.  You know I love you all the time and think more of you than all the women of the world put together.  I have always loved you since I met you six and a half years ago.  I loved you when I argued with you as much as I did when we were having a jolly good time together.  Now, ten thousand miles away, I love you much more.  I am eager to come back home to you.  I want to come home.  I dream of coming home and hope to come home.  I lost my chance for the month of March, but I am hoping for later months.  It’s my goal to come back as healthy as I left and as a man who has done his duty for his country.  I want you to be proud of me that I am doing my part honestly and as a man.  Some people go home today.  I do not like to go home in that way.

I had a few hard days in the field.  I even went as long as twenty-four hours with only a piece of toast and a cup of coffee.  I slept last night under a leaking tent that disturbed my sleep.  I feel well now.  I am going to bed soon in my old tent to have a long, peaceful sleep in my cot.  I am surprised at myself.  I can take a hard life as well as anybody else without getting sick.  

Do you remember the officers who we left in Fort Lewis in 1942?  I heard that they left for an unknown destination.  At least I am used to hard life.  They have to start now.  Pepe went home.  He was such a mess.  He lost more than twenty pounds.  He was skin and bones, poor fellow!  He could not take it!

Lately it has rained, not much, but often.  The heat is no longer excessive.  We are moving toward the fall.  I am eating apples and peaches and grapes.  Within ten days, we will officially be in the fall.

Mrs. Taylor asked me about you.  She wants to know if you received the pictures she sent you.  Have you received the sheepskin rug?  I received your two telegrams a long time ago.

I am getting sleepy.  It’s dark and quiet outside.  I’ll write you soon.  I love you with all my heart.
										I am all yours,

Yesterday, I started my twenty-third month of overseas duty.  The months keep piling up!  How many more?  It will never be too soon for me.

I am feeling well as usual.  I enjoy the good summer weather and the sleepy cool nights.  I had a few days of rest.  Since last Friday, I have seen a picture nearly every night here in camp or in town.  I have read a book “The Art of Thinking.”  It helped to flatter my “ego.”  

Have you received my mail?  I have not received any from you during the last three days.  I am not complaining.

I am wishing and hoping and dreaming and yearning to be able to kiss you again.

Two years ago at this time, we were planning for our trip to the South that ended by taking us across the country.

Within a few hours, I’ll leave for another trip.  I am going back to school.  It will be a short course of about one week.  I like to move, but I dread these slow and tiresome trains.

I am feeling fine.  The weather is summer-like.

										March 1, 1944


My darling Annette,

I have been here for three whole days.  It took me one day and a long night of deep sleep to recuperate from the trip.  You know by now from my previous letters that these obsolete Australian trains are very shaky and trembling and jerking.  They stop so often and so suddenly that I have to keep myself on guard so as not to be thrown on the floor of the car.  I had no chance to get a bed.  I tried to bribe the conductor, but I did not succeed.  I had to sit all night.

I have gone to school since Monday.  It is not bad here.  I have no responsibility.  I get up at seven A.M. for breakfast, shave and wash, then go to school at 8 A.M. The lectures go on until noon, an hour for lunch, then school from 1-5 P.M. I have enjoyed myself.  It’s a pleasure for me to sit down and listen to talks about things I have been seeing and curing for many months.  This school is run by doctors and is run for doctors.  So I feel perfectly at home.  The food is good.  I reviewed a few names, medical terms, for instance sporozoite, merozoite, gametocyte, etc.  They are all big names.  Yesterday afternoon, I was in the laboratory for many hours looking and gazing at the germs in many forms.  It was a real experience.  My eyes were tired and watering last night.  I went to bed early and gave them a good rest.  I feel perfectly fine today. 

I like it here.  It’s a change of scenery.  I get tired of staying in one place all the time.  There is only one person that I’ll never be tired of seeing and that’s you.  I was and am wondering how long must I LONG to see you.

Do you remember two years ago?  We were going to Louisiana.  It was grand, like a dream or like a movie.  It does feel like a dream, so far from reality.  I have wished so long, I have dreamed so long, I have waited so long to be able to come home and be with you forever.

I am going on as usual.  I have put on some weight.  I am 164 pounds.  Four pounds more than I was four months ago.  The food is good.  I only wish that the nights were warmer.  I need four blankets.  It is not cold, but I feel cold.  Yesterday morning at 5 A.M. the temperature was 68 degrees.  But it was cold for me.  I am getting to be a sissy as far as cold weather is concerned, don’t you think?

I don’t know when my lucky number will be picked up.  I hope to get home during the summer months.

How is everybody at home?  How are you, my darling?  I have not received any news from you.  I cannot expect it until I go back to my old camp.  I’ll be here for a few days more.  This course will only last a few days more.  I am glad I came at this time when the sun is not so hot.

Darling, I love you and keep counting the days.  I hope they will be few.

I love you and am all yours.

My darling Annette,

I am ready to go back to camp to my usual routine.  The course is finished and everybody is leaving.  I have packed my things and I’ll leave as soon as I get transportation.  I had a good stay here.  Nothing exciting but a few good lectures that I enjoyed very much.  I know enough about mosquitoes now to take care of them.

I have seen a few movies in my free time and had a few good meals at the officers club in town.  It is starting to get cool and I was shivering this morning.  I used four blankets!  I am getting to be a sissy, don’t you think?  

I am anxious to go back to camp.  I have not heard from you for a few days.  Tomorrow I hope to be able to read your letters.

I am feeling well.  How are you, darling?  I love you, I miss you here and always.  I love you with all my heart.

My darling Annette,

I have returned to my old camp.  I found all your mail.  I arrived at midnight, looked for your mail, found it, read it, and went to bed tired, but happy.  

I am sorry, darling, but I am not the one you saw in the picture.  I never was so lucky to have my picture taken while at work.  The only picture I had taken by a camera man was at church in New Guinea.  No, darling, I have not worn a black necktie for more than two years, nor have I worked with nurses since 1941 in New Jersey.  My coworkers are all men with a capital M.  I usually wear my wedding ring.  I don’t wear it when I have to wash my hands for some operation or when I have to put my hands in pus or alcohol.  I keep it tied to a string with my dog tags for identification.

I came back from school where I have refreshed my memory.  It seemed to me as if I were back to my school days again.  The teaching was very good, all based on practical and painful experience.  It was an interchange of ideas in a certain way.  

I am sorry that the mail has been fickle.  I experienced the same thing.  I was silent for a couple of weeks though I wrote to you regularly at least twice a week.

I am enclosing a money order of $80.  I wanted to buy you something for Easter but the prices were too exorbitant.  

I am feeling well.  I am sorry you had a cold.  I have not experienced one for at least two years thanks to this good climate.

Darling, I do love you.  I am hoping to come home to you.  I am dreaming about it.

										I am yours,

P.S.	It’s 25 months today of our happy event!

My darling Annette,

I have been trying to write this letter many times.  So far, I was interrupted by a discussion about what is the best form of government.  I am going to try to finish it now.  

During the last two days, I received all the letters you wrote between January 20 and February 21.  They all came in together.  

I am sorry, darling, to have caused you some mental anguish.  I am sorry you mother has been sick.  I hope she is well again.  Don’t worry, darling.  Your remarks did not hurt me.  I was so happy to receive your letters that I overlooked them.  Moreover, I read your apologies and your sarcastic remarks at the same time.  I was anxious to hear from you.  I was and am very happy to read your letters.

The girl you saw in the picture is an American Red Cross worker and so is the man who looks so much like me.  I have not worn a black necktie since 1941, nor have I worked in a hospital since 1941.  To have my picture taken by a motion picture camera would have been such an experience for me that I would have written to you many times.  

When you see Mrs. Taylor’s pictures, you’ll see an old lady who looks a great deal like your mother.  I went to visit them when I was in my old camp.  I like her and Mr. Taylor.  They have been very kind to me.  Their morals were and are as high as we have in our families.  Moreover, I could talk to Mrs. Taylor about my wife.  She raised three children who are all married now and who are all very clean.

I am sorry that I caused you some suffering.  The irregularity of the mail service helped to make things worse.  I understand you, darling, and don’t blame you at all.  I, for myself, have always loved you.  I love you now, as much and more than I did a year or two ago.  There is no woman in Australia or in the whole world who can take my wife’s place in my heart.  I love you, darling, with all my heart and soul.  I have only one hope and one wish and one desire that keeps me going and that is to be back with you.  This has been my feeling during the last twenty-three months.

I am anxious to know how you found my folks.  Write to me often.  I am going to try to do the same when it is physically possible.

I love you. 

										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

Do you know what I am doing at least two or three times a day?  I go into the lounge and open a beautiful atlas where there is a map of the 48 states.  I follow day by day the trip we made.  At this time of the day two years ago, we were in San Diego.  Do you remember the beautiful, sunny, spring-like afternoon we found there?  We had a lovely room and we had a good supper!

I was not sweating then as I do now.  It’s hot every hour of the day.  I have to dry my hands so as not to wet this paper.  I wake up in the morning and I am all wet and clammy.  My bed is hard.  I am getting used to it.  The first time I slept on it, my bones were aching.  I sleep well now.  I am eating well, three meals a day, and morning tea and afternoon tea at 10:30 and 3:30.  Both teas consist of a cup of tea, marmalade or jam, and bread.  We have a beer when beer is served or liquor three times a day.  I usually have a soft drink.  I drink a beer occasionally.  I am not able to take two glasses.

So far, everything is going smoothly.  I am not very busy.  I have travelled long distances lately.  I am still going on, sliding on, uneventfully.  I dream of you very often.  I love you with all my heart.  I have one hope that keeps me going.  I am looking forward to the day when I’ll meet you again.

										I love you,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

At this time two years ago, we left San Francisco for Crescent City.  Do you remember how it rained that morning?  We crossed the Golden Gate bridge, hazed by the rain, and moved on, unconsciously happy.  I wish I were back to that day, to those days.  I have a feeling that they will come back.  We are paying a high price for our happiness when we will be back together.

I am feeling well.  I am not very busy.  It’s warm during the day, but the nights are cool.  I am hoping that my number to come home will be picked soon.

Have you been to see my folks?  I sent you a money order of $80.  I had saved that money for my leave that I was supposed to get.  I am not going to get it for a long while, so I sent you the money.  You can use it.  Don’t you want to buy an Easter bonnet?

I wish you a Happy Easter.

Have my undying love.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

Two years ago, we were looking for a house in Tacoma, Washington.  Do you remember?  But 23 months ago, we separated unwillingly and painfully!

How are you, my darling wife?  I have not heard from you for the last twelve days.  

I have been moving so much that the mail has a hard time to follow me.  I hope that I’ll be settled for a while now.  I am in a wonderful place, ten times better than the place I was before.  The scenery is enchanting.  I have drunk my first coconut milk this year.  I love it.  I know you would like it too.  Yesterday, I visited a native village.  These natives behave and appear to be more intelligent than those I met a year ago.

I am feeling well.  I get good food and have a good sleep every night.  The days are really warm, but the nights are cool enough to require a blanket.  

I am keeping my fingers crossed in my hope to come home.  I am anxiously waiting for mail.  In the meantime, I send you all my love.


										I am all yours,


										Silvio

										March 22, 1944


My darling Annette,

From my previous letters, you reckoned that I had moved to some island in the Pacific.  Today I can tell you the name of the island.  As you saw it written in the date line, it’s New Guinea again.  I had a very pleasant trip in a ship that in peacetime was carrying passengers around the world.  I had good food and good drinks.  I wish, darling, you could travel in a ship like that on such a calm sea.  The sea was always so calm that I did not notice that it moved.  The sea was as smooth as the water in a pail.  It’s hot at times, but I did not mind it.

I am back in New Guinea.  I cannot tell you where I am.  I can only tell you that I like this place a hundred times more than the one I left in Australia.  I eat good food, sleep comfortably during the always cool nights, and can go to see a show at least three times a week.  I take a shower daily.  I prefer to take my shower soon after the noon hour.  I have a wonderful view from my dwelling place.  I cannot describe it, but it’s wonderful.

Yesterday, I read your letter of February 29, today that of March 3.  I am happy now.  I was waiting.  I had not heard from you for more than two weeks.  Don’t worry, darling, about your two letters.  I read them when I came back from school.  Then, things happened very suddenly and I was very busy.  I read your apology before I read your letters.  I was so happy to hear from you that I overlooked what you wrote.

I am sorry about Auntie.  I noticed that when I was in Lowell.  There is nothing to do but to understand her and to help her.  Believe me, it’s not her fault.  She cannot help it.

I hope I’ll be able to come home and see that Mother has her eyes taken care of.  I know that in most cases an operation gives back the lost sight.  I saw so many cases regain their sight at St. Joseph’s Hospital.

Darling, don’t worry about me because I am feeling well.  There is no excitement around here.

As always, I love you with all my heart.


										Yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Today I start my third year of service with this Regiment.  Two years ago today, we left Shelton and moved to Fort Lewis.  I would not like to relive those days that followed it.  My heart was torn to pieces.  I suffered untold tortures physically and mentally.  I was as happy as I had ever been in my life and then all of a sudden I saw my dreams shattered.  I hope, however, that I’ll be able to start again where we left off.

I am glad you went to Larchmont to visit my folks and to hear that they look well.  I am sure that they were very happy to see you.  You know how old people are!  They don’t like to move, to change their daily routine, etc.  I am not surprised to read that you and Dad had a discussion about global politics.  I am sure you do not agree.  It’s Dad’s hobby.  He has been interested and studied it since he was a young man.  He reads many newspapers and magazines.  He can read between the lines and it’s hard to fool him.  He is a realist and an idealist at the same time.  He is bitter against those who strive to destroy his hope of a better world.  I had arguments with him and never got anywhere unless I could demonstrate my points to him with facts.

I am happy to know that your mother is feeling well.  She will improve as the weather becomes warmer.  

Will you excuse me for writing in such a small handwriting?  I am short of paper.  I don’t know when I’ll be able to get some and do not want to be without it.  

Yesterday, I sent in the application to be sent back home.  I did not mince any words.  I told them that I want and must go back home to be with my wife, at least for a while.  Otherwise, my morale will crumble and I’ll be no good to the United States and to myself.  I have hopes and keep my fingers crossed.

I am glad that you found a position in Lowell.  I really dreaded the idea of you commuting to and from Lowell during the winter months.  I hope you’ll like your work and that they treat you well.  If not, you don’t have to worry because your husband will take care of you.  I think that a position is good.  It keeps your mind occupied and at the same time gives you a feeling of accomplishment.  However, if the work is too hard and the people you work with are not cooperative and appreciative, don’t stay.

Today it’s a rainy day.  It started during the night and it’s still raining, though not very hard.  I like it, the tick tock of the drops falling on my tent.  Do you remember?  It’s comfortable, neither warm nor cold.  I like being here.

I can tell you the cities and places I have been last year, or better since I came overseas.  I visited Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, and other small towns in Australia.  In New Guinea, I visited Port Moresby, Milne Bay, Bura and Gona and I walked along the Kokoda Trail.  I cannot tell you where I am now.  That’s a military secret and rightly so.  Yesterday, we received permission to mention the places I visited.

I am feeling well and don’t have any complaints.  I have been reading many books lately like “Wind, Sand and Stars” and “U.S. Foreign Policy” and “Kabloona” by de Poncins.   I am now reading “Country Lawyer” by Bellamy Partridge.  I enjoyed reading “U.S. Foreign Policy” by Walter Lippmann.  I agree with him, if not with all his points, with many.  I like his honesty and judgment.

Until next time, have as many kisses as the rain drops that have fallen and will fall here today.

I love you tenderly, deeply, and cordially.


										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I received your letter of March 16, the letter you wrote partly before and partly after your return home.  I have not received any letters that you wrote during your visit to Larchmont about how you enjoyed yourself in New York.  

You have gone through some mental anguish lately.  I am sorry, but it’s not my fault.  In your letter, you asked me if I love you.  You tell me you believe I love you, but you are not sure because you ask me the question “Am I right?”  Of course I love you, darling.  I am eager to hear from you.  I understand you very well, darling.  

Don’t believe that silly and stupidly boasting girl.  Where she was, there was no suffering, the rat!  You have no idea how eager we are to go home.  It’s the subject of our daily talks, it’s our main subject of conversation.  Every time that the mail is late, there is a feeling of tension that is dispelled as soon as mail reaches us.  I wish I could see the boasting brat and give her a piece of my mind.  I never met her, nor even heard about her.  Due to censorship regulations, I cannot tell you all I know.  I would betray our cause.  For safety reasons and keeping to censorship regulations, I cannot tell you many things that would and could dispel some of your doubts.  

You know one thing.  You receive an allotment, most of my pay.  The rest I send to Dad occasionally.  I have not spent more than $20. or $30. a month on myself considering that I have to pay for laundry and new clothing.  I like movies and while in Australia, I went to the movies nearly every night.  It’s a way to forget for a while and live in another world.  I like Coke and a glass or at the most two glasses of beer during the warmest part of the day.  That’s where all my money went.  How can you have a good time with such an amount of money?  If I believed what I hear from the men who just came here from the States, I should be jealous too.  Sometimes I am for a second or two.  But I trust you and believe that you are the best wife in the whole world and forget about it and consider it a passing mood that a man in love should experience.  Let’s forget about all this gossip that does not do any good to anybody and has a taste of enemy propaganda.

I am here in New Guinea and like it.  You don’t have any reason to be jealous because the native women are repugnant.  I read a great deal.  I am reading nearly a book every day.  I read and finished “The Country Lawyer” and enjoyed it.  I had to stop reading at times and have a good laugh.  Last night, I started to read “The Native’s Return” by Louis Adamic.  I find it refreshing.  It reminds me of my youth and produces in me a nostalgic feeling of past times.

I am waiting for my turn to be sent home.  When it will come, I do not know.  I only hope it will be soon.  Then you’ll find out how much I love you.  As soon as I come back, I intend to make up for all the time we lost.  I love you.
								I am all yours,          Silvio

My darling Annette,

I have received your letter of March 15 that you wrote in Larchmont after visiting Rose in New York City.

No, darling, you cannot compare me with Paul.  He has an apartment with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom.  He has a secretary in his office.  He has the money, time, and opportunity to enjoy a good time.  He never has to sleep on the ground, to walk for hours and hours until his feet and legs ache.  He never has to take care of two scores of patients every day.  Where he is, there are ten girls for one man.  Where I have been, there were twenty men to one girl.  Moreover, we had a very poor transportation system.

I saw the Taylors a few times.  I played golf with Mr. Taylor during the cold season.  I stopped playing in December.  It was too hot.  As I told you before, Mrs. Taylor has two daughters and one son.  They are all married.  One daughter has two children.  The other, a schoolteacher, lives four hundred miles west of the town where her folks live.  I met her when she came east to meet her husband.  I like her and him.  He is a soldier.  I like them because we have something in common.  They got married three days before we did.  They were separated by the war for nearly two years.  She is very much in love with her husband.

The Taylors are a very respectable family.  I never heard them cursing.  They have a nice house.  They invited me to stay with them many times.  I never remained there because they had too many mosquitoes.  The old man, Mr.Taylor, is a very good golf player.  He taught me many things.  On the other hand, I compensated him by offering him a carton of American cigarettes.  He loves them.  The son is married.  He married a few months after I came back from New Guinea.  I did not see much of him or his wife.  Their honeymooning was taking up all of their time.  I like the family as a whole because they are nice people of a very high moral character.  All together, I have visited them seven or eight times.  I have been moving nearly all the time, as you know from my letters.

You don’t have to worry about your husband, darling.  I love you as much today as I did two years ago and much more.  I think that I will dispel any doubts as soon as I’ll meet you again.  I am as I was when I left you.

I have done, darling, everything that is humanly possible to be sent home. I am waiting for my chance.

It’s lovely here.  I had a good meal today.  Last night, I saw “The Lost Angel.”  I liked it.

I love you very, very much.
										I am yours,

										Silvio 

P.S.	I asked the representative of the Red Cross if he knew Miss Thompson.  He knows her well.  She was never with my division.  Moreover, she was sent back home because they did not know what to do with her.  She was more a handicap to the unit than an asset.  This is all I know about her.  It all agrees with her queer behavior and unladylike attitude toward the most sacred emotion of mankind.


										I am yours,

										Silvio

										Palm Sunday
										April 2, 1944

My darling and beloved wife,

Today, I received the letters you wrote on February 8, 11, 14 and guess what?  I received the sheepskin rug!  It made me wild.  It went as far as Portland, Maine.  It passed the censorship and was sent back without any explanation.  Somebody got a brainstorm.  Tomorrow I am going to send it to you again.

I’m sorry to have caused you so much trouble and suffering.  Darling, I always love you with all my heart.  You don’t have to worry about it.  You know that I love you and that I’ll always love you.  It’s part of me.  It’s myself.  It will last to my last breath.  I have always been yours, body and soul.

Don’t get upset about promotions.  If the Colonel or General was able to give me a promotion, they would without hesitation.  I cannot tell you any more without betraying Army secrets.  Don’t worry, darling, I am treated well.  I have never been passed yet.

I am sorry, darling, I’m not the one you see in the picture.  The only Red Cross workers I met were in Sydney and then only because they served the best meals in town.  In Sydney, Mr. Shaw, Professor of Literature at the University, treated me royally.  He took me to many places.  I liked him and enjoyed his company.  He had seen and known people in Italy.  

The funny thing is that when you were undergoing your mental anguish, I was working very hard, sleeping in the rain on the ground, and walking and walking for miles and miles for days.  If you were suffering mentally, I was suffering physically.  I am with an infantry division and my life is not a joke or a pleasure experience.  Moreover, with $20. or $30. a month that I have spent on myself, I never could afford to rent an apartment that costs from $30. to $50 a month, nor buy any liquor that costs from $10. to $15. a quart.  I have sent you $1400. and about $400. to Mother and Dad since I have been overseas.

I was asked many times what I saved my money for.  I answered that I’m saving because I want to enjoy every penny I earned to the fullest and the only way I can do that is to share it and spend it with you.  

You’ll never know how much I love you and how many times I lose myself in a daydream.  I yearn so much to come home and see you that I would be willing to go A.W.O.L. if I knew I could come to you.  I would be willing to pay the high price.  But I would not try because I know very well that I would not go very far and there is no use to try foolishness.  You know that I like to do my duty and be a man.  It’s my duty to sacrifice myself so that you dear ones can enjoy safety and well being.  I don’t regret it.  I said that to let you know how I feel sometimes and how much I love you.

Don’t believe what people say.  I told Major Ron the other day that I don’t have to worry about my wife because she is a good Catholic and does not believe in divorce.  He was kidding me.  He knows I have a beautiful wife.  I told him I’m sure I’ll find her at home waiting for me.  I have faith in you and I do trust you.

I’m sorry.  It’s getting dark.  When daylight will come again, I’ll start my 39th month in the service of Uncle Sam.

I love you very much.


											I am yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

This is the third time I start this letter.  I had to discard the two previous letters because I know that they would not have passed the censor.  An hour ago, I was so disappointed that I wrote what I am not supposed to write.  It all goes with my overseas service.  Who wouldn’t be bitter when on a day like today just two years ago I was very happy and now I’m lonesome and anxious to go home and disappointed because I cannot go home?

I’m still here.  I am well except for a sprained ankle.  I sprained it two nights ago while going to visit a patient.  It hurt badly.  I’m feeling better now.  A branch of a tree made me lose my balance and down I went, suffering a sharp pain in my right ankle.  I had an x-ray taken.  No fracture was found.  I’ll be well again in a few days.  This is my first trouble since I came overseas.  I’m not used to pain and I resented it and became angry at my ankle.

Yes, I’ll never forget two years ago today.  Do you remember?  We played ping pong on the porch and loved it.  We rode to the majestic Mt. Rainier and enjoyed it, playing in the snow.  Oh, how I wish I was back there!  If I’m not going to be sent back within six months, to be exact by Christmas, 1944, I’m going to do something drastic.  I don’t think that I can stand it any longer.

I am glad that you are back at work.  This will keep your mind busy.  You’ll have something to do.  You’ll have a feeling of accomplishing something.  I’m glad that you don’t have to work nights and glad that you are not working at a dangerous job.  It had me worried many times, especially every time I heard that people were injured while working in factories.

I hope your mother is feeling well.  She has my heartfelt wishes for a quick recovery.  Tell her that it’s too warm here now to think of wearing the flannel pajamas.

I read you last v-mail of March 21.  I think I received your last letters from the period when you were suffering without cause.  

I’m loving you with all my heart.


									I’ll always be yours,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

Why didn’t you smile in one of the pictures you sent to me?  Did you want to get even with me?  I had tried to send you a picture with a big smile.  You saw the small one.  I had it enlarged and I was going to send it to you.  You cannot imagine how silly I look in it.  So I kept it.  However, I am pleased to receive your snapshots.  It gave me a thrill and I kept on looking at them time and time again.  I have shown them proudly to all my friends.  You look as charming and as beautiful as ever.  Oh, how I wish I could put my arms around your shoulders and kiss your adorable mouth!  No, darling, you don’t look older.  You have gained in poise.  One picture betrays the doubts that were puzzling your mind.  I love the one you took alone standing in front of the door steps of the house.  You look as I love to see you.

I am sorry to have delayed writing you for a few days.  I have been quite busy, doing one thing or another.  I have not read any books lately.  You know how it is.  A couple of weeks ago, everybody was reading one book after another.  I was reading three books at the same time.  I got tired of it and turned to playing cards.  I have played pinochle, won and lost and lost and won.  I play cribbage occasionally.  I never play for money.

The nights are lovely.  I have seen a few pictures lately.  I see at least three a week.  I don’t have to walk more than seventy yards to go to the movies and less than that to go to church.  Indeed, I can listen to both from my cot.  

I am feeling well.  My right ankle is nearly healed.  I can walk straight and fast now.  The men have been making jokes about it.  They had a laugh.  I enjoyed the joke with the men.

I’m going to try very hard not to disappoint you.  I’ll try to be with you by your birthday.  If not then, at least by mine!

Thank you for the lovely letter you wrote on March 26.  It gave me great pleasure and made me very happy.  I felt as if I had the world in the palm of my hands!

I love you very much, very much.

Have as many kisses as there are ripples in the ocean or as there are drops during a rainstorm in New Guinea.

My darling and beloved wife,

Time and time again today, I am remembering this date two years ago.  Tonight, I start my third year of overseas duty.  Tonight, I start my third year since I saw you with the fervent hope that it will be the last one.

I have not heard from you for a while.  I’m carrying with me the lovely letter you wrote me about a month ago.  I cherish it.

I’m well.  I eat well.  I sleep badly because of the excessive heat.  It’s common to sit down or lie down and be all wet with sweat.  It does not bother me much.  It does not affect my appetite, anyhow.  I take frequent showers that cool me off momentarily.

I have no time to send a note to Dad.  Will you remember me to him in your letters?

I have to cut this letter short because soon I have to go to a meeting and maybe talk about something.

I’ll be thinking of you all the time.  I love you, my darling, with all my heart and do wish and yearn to be sent home to you.

I’m counting the weeks.  I can’t think that I can stand it any longer.  Just a little bit more.

How is your work?  Is it taking too much of your time?  You have been at it for an entire month now.  I hope you are getting used to it and find time to remember your Silvio.

I love you very, very much.

My darling Annette,

I am writing to you from a new camp.  

I am feeling well with the exception of a slight sunburn.  I remained in the tropical sun a little too long.  It is not bad, however.

I have been busy lately.  I have saved a few of Uncle Sam’s nephews.

I have not heard any news from you for more than two weeks.

I like it here.  I can take a bath daily in clear, cool water.  I am eating good food, if not too much.

I am longing to come home.



										I love you.
