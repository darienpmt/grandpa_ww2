My darling Annette,

I hope this letter will find you as well as I am now. 

Lately, I have enjoyed myself.  My main worry has been how to kill my time.  I have gone bathing and sunbathing at least twice a day.  I have acquired a very good tan.  The food has been good, but scarce.  However, I’m putting on some weight.  

I have not received any mail from you or from my folks for the last three weeks.  I’m starting to get worried.  

A few moments ago, I drank a good glass of coconut juice.  I love it and drink it.

Among my souvenirs I have a Jap flag, parachute, truck, some tents, and a HEN (chicken).  This is our mascot!



											I love you.

My darling Annette,

Due to lack of paper, I have to use the v-mail stationery for the time being.  I have received, darling, the mail you wrote me up to April 13.  It was a grand day for me yesterday when I read your lovely letters.  Twenty-one days is too long a time to go without receiving a word from the sweetest girl in the world.

Last night, I had a peaceful, comfortable sleep in my hammock.  Everything around was muddy and soaking wet after the worst rain storm I have ever experienced, but my hammock and my silk sheets were as dry as the sand of the desert.  To value and appreciate this comfort, one has to sleep on the wet ground, to walk all night in knee-deep mud while the rain falls, to be all wet from head to foot and covered with black, sticky mud that smells like a pig sty. 

Darling, I am well.  I don’t have a scratch on my skin.  I have not lost any weight.  At present, I can enjoy a shower and other pleasures of life.  I am hoping and dreaming of coming home. 

I love you.  Have a kiss for every drop of rain that fell last night.  

							
										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

It’s the end of a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  The sun has been shining all day long and has dried the muddy roads.  

I took this occasion to do my washing.  I’m now all clean.  I had a good shower and a fair supper.  A day like today I would prefer to pass with you and enjoy with you.  Someday I’ll be able to do it.

I am feeling well.  I have no complaints except that I would like to come home.  

On May 7, our 27 month anniversary, I started the day by giving my ration of chocolate to a hungry, starving Jap who was made a prisoner a couple of hundred yards from me.  He needed it more than I did even though he was my enemy only half an hour before.  

I’ll be around here for a while.  

I love you very, very much.  

										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

A few more days and then it will be twenty-five months since I waved goodbye to you.  Twenty-five months is a long time in a man’s life.  How long I’ll be overseas I don’t know.  I wish I could leave for home this minute.  My patience is drawing to an end.  I don’t think I’ll be able to stand it much longer.  I want to go home.  I promise you that I’ll not leave a stone unturned, even if I have to go home as a neurotic.  I made up my mind.  You know that when I make up my mind, come what will come, I do what I want to do.  Anyway, I’ll be home by Christmas if I cannot make it by your birthday.

As you heard from the radio or read in the papers, my unit has been engaged with the enemy.  I took part in it and discharged my duties efficiently.  I am proud to say that all the men who I treated are living today, not only living, but on the way to a perfect recovery.  Out of six days of campaigning, I have been on the front lines for five days.  I have been as near to the front lines as any man in my unit.  I have been under direct enemy fire three times.  Once I was taking care of a man for a skin disease when suddenly all h___ broke loose.  The man was wounded.  I was untouched.  That was the closest I came to being wounded.  Only a few inches!  Your prayers were heard.  That was on April 25 at 5:30 in the afternoon.

The previous day, I ran the gauntlet of fire.  Bullets were bursting all around.  I went, then, to take care of a man only 50 yards from the enemy.  I had to crawl, run, hide, and jump.  I made it in time.  That man is living today and on the way to recovery.  Those were exciting days, full of adventure and anxiety.  I can sincerely say that I was never afraid.  My heart never beat fast or I never felt it with the exception of a few minutes before the attack started.  My heart beat fast then for a few minutes.  I was conscious that the moment to act had come.  

I had ups and downs during the campaign.  My morale has always been very high.  I was conscious and proud to give all the help I could to my fellow men.  I had my own fight, the fight against death, and I won.  I saw many Japs, dead and alive.  I took care of some.  I do not consider them a superior race.  I felt a sense of pity and commiseration for the poor devils.  

I had my chances at souvenir hunting.  I got a parachute and two flags and some medical instruments.  That’s all I want.  I tasted Jap liquor and drank some of their exquisite wine.  It tastes like cherry or port wine.  

As a whole, I don’t regret the campaign even though I slept in a foxhole with my feet in the mud.  I got all wet from head to toe.  I have gone for days with only a few hours of sleep.

Now, everything is calm.  I have had my rest.  Life is monotonous again.  

I am dreaming of going home.  I want to go home.  I love you.  I live to see the day I’ll meet you again and hope that that day is not too far off.

I love you immensely.


										I am all yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I am again in the mood to complain.  The mail service is slow, irregular and late.  I have not heard from you for a long time.  Your last letter was written April 13.  37 days ago!

I have moved again.  I have been moving so often that I’ll have a hard time to settle down.  But I am sure that I’ll never have a hard time to settle down with you.  I am dreaming and looking forward to that day.

I like this place.  It’s restful and quiet.  My sleeping place is only a few yards from the sea.  I can hear the splashing of the water during the silent night.  I have gone swimming every afternoon.  It’s a grand beach, miles and miles long.  The water is getting deeper and deeper gradually.  The water is warm, but not hot.  I have acquired a good tan.  I am not black, but not far from it.

How are you?  How is your work?  I wish I were home during this month and June.  They are so beautiful in Lowell!

I am feeling as usual.  The food has not been so good lately and I don’t like the taste of the drinking water.  I have to drink it with a piece of candy in my mouth to neutralize the bad taste.

In compensation, however, is the easy life with nothing to worry about except food and sleep.  I have a hammock that I got from a fellow.  It takes me only a few minutes to get my bed ready.  I am still using my silk sheets.  My hammock is mosquito-proof and waterproof.  I am able to sleep comfortably, even when it pours or when the mosquitoes are busy buzzing around.  There is no greater pleasure in the jungle than to listen during the night to the mosquitoes buzzing around and to be sure that they will not be able to bite.

I guess that I lost some weight.  I like it.  I was too fat.  I feel better to be light.

I am glad that there are no chiggers here.  I hate those insects.  They cause a persistent, annoying, troublesome itching that is worse at night.

I reckon that you read in the papers what is going on in this part of the world.  The papers are able and have more facilities than we have.  I am only allowed to write to you what happens to me.  I think this is what really interests you.  

I can hardly wait for the day when I’ll come home.  I hope that the day will not be too far off. Tomorrow, I begin my 26th month overseas!

									I am all yours,      Silvio

My darling Annette,

Yesterday, after a long silence, I was happily able to read the letter you wrote April 22.  It took 29 days to come to me.

I remembered that day, but not for long.  I had no time to remember the past.  That day, the surrounding circumstances cut me out completely from the past.  That day, the present had me all in.  That day, the sight of the American flag flying on a promontory produced in me a feeling that I never experienced before.  It gave me a feeling of exaltation.  It relaxed untold anxiety.  It gave hope where there had been desperation, a breaking spell of life where death was impending.  It was a day that I will never forget and that I hope I will never experience again.

Needless to say, today the 27th month of overseas duty is starting.  I am tired of counting these past months.  I should start to count how many months more.  

You ask me to send you the name of my commanding officer.  I cannot do it.  It’s against regulations.  You can find other ways.  You are a free citizen.  You are not tied to any military law.  You may write to your senator, to your congressman.  These are the people who represent you at the Capital.

It’s a lovely day here, warm with a gentle breeze that tries to blow these pages into the thick jungle only a couple of yards from me.  As soon as I finish writing to you, I’ll go in for a good swim and a sunbath.  The sun is shining bright and hot in the sky.  The heat does not bother me.

I don’t like the water that I must drink.  It’s awful.  At least you can drink ginger ale.  I have no choice but drink this awful water or go thirsty.  The food is fair.

I am feeling well.  I had it very easy during the past two weeks.  I don’t know what the future is holding in store for me.

I hope that my turn to come home will come soon.  I am so eager to be with you!  I love you, darling.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

P.S.	Please send me the Sunday New York Times every week.

My darling Annette,

I have just received your mail.  It helped to lift my morale sky high.  I got your v-mail letter of May 2.  It’s quite recent, considering my past experience.  I hope by now that you have received all my letters since the campaign started.

I am feeling well.  At present, I have no complaints except that I am fed up with the overseas service.  I want to come home, even if it’s only for a little while.

I am always thinking of you.  I love you very much.

This is the first time in twenty-one days that I have the chance and paper to write you.

As a first thing, I wish you a Happy Birthday!  I can’t send you any presents.  I have not been paid during the last four months.  

I am well.  I have lost a lot of weight.  I am healthy.  

I have been in action and am at this moment.  I’ll write you more as soon as I can.

Write to my folks and tell them that I am well.

I have been very, very busy.  I am not in New Guinea.

I love you very much.

My darling wife,


Within a few days, you’ll celebrate your birthday.  You wanted me home by then.  But I am still far away with no hope in sight to get a trip home.  

However, I must be thankful that I am able to write to you, considering what I have gone through.  I am thankful that I am well and feel good.  At present, I have no complaints, but I wish they would send us some fresh food.  I am tired of canned food.  It does not meet my requirements and makes me lose weight.

I renew my best wishes for your birthday.  

I have nothing else to say but to repeat the old, too old saying that I hope I’ll be with you for next year’s birthday.  

Darling, I do love you.

My darling and beloved Annette,

It’s quiet again and I have time and paper again to write to you.  

I am feeling very well today.  I had a peaceful sleep last night and a good breakfast this morning.  

You will understand that my long periods of non-letter writing are against my own will and due to circumstances beyond my control.  I am thankful not to have suffered any injury or ailment during the past month which was one of the worst of my whole life.

A week from today, you’ll celebrate your birthday.   I guess it will not be a happy one knowing that I am going through a h___ of a time.

I have not, darling, received any news from you since April 20 and that was almost three weeks ago.  I wish this lousy mail service would step up and help to keep my morale a little bit higher.

Again, I have to tell you that my weight is going down.

Remember me to your people.

I love you very, very much.


										I am all yours,

									Somewhere in the Pacific
									June 30, 1944

My darling Annette,

Happy days are here again!  You know I mean relatively speaking because I’ll be happy only when I will be home with you.  I said happy days are here again because between last night and this morning I received all the letters you wrote between April 6 and June 1.  I had a long chat with you.  I found out that your intuition has been mostly right.  I was going through danger when you felt it, but not as bad as you imagined.  I am sorry you have not received some of the letters I wrote you at the end of the previous campaign.  In one I gave you a minute description of everything that happened to me.  I’ll write you a long letter soon and I’ll describe to you what I have experienced recently.

One thing I want to tell you.  Please do not complain about your fate.  You do not know what a lucky girl you are.  Do not complain, darling, but kneel down and thank the Almighty that I am healthy in body and sound of mind.  I came out of this hell untouched, unscratched, unhurt.  Do not think for a second that I am a hero because I have been scared.  I confess that more than once I noticed my legs shivering and not from the cold.  I laugh at it now and talk about it.  I only tell you that I saw hell.

I worked hard.  I have been very, very busy.  I am proud to say that I have done my best to the best of my ability.  There are many men living today who owe their lives to my intervention.  This is something that Pepe and Paul will never be able to talk about.  Do not complain, darling, but think how lucky you are.  There are many wives and sweethearts who are much worse off than you are.  

I saw all the money we saved.  I know I married the best girl in the whole world and I am mighty proud of it.  

I like the picture you sent.  Why don’t you smile?  

I don’t have any objections if Mother wants to change the ownership of the house.  It’s your house.

I have tried my best to be sent home.  Sure I talked to the Colonel and even to the General.  But what good did it do?  I am badly needed here.  My chance will come soon I hope.  I have talked to the Division Surgeon many times.  We are kind of pals.  He is still here and came overseas a month before me.  He is ten years older than myself.  So far, only old men have left.  My chance will come.  Do not spend a penny hoping to get help from the politicians.  They are not worth it.  Moreover, they are helpless.  You can see Edith Nourse Rogers and talk to her, but don’t give a penny to anybody.  You can write to your Senator and your member of the House of Representatives.  You know that you are a free citizen, whereas I am a man in uniform and subject to military law.  I wish you knew something about military law.  It would help you to understand my situation.

I forgot to finish telling you why I think that happy days are here again.  Yesterday, I had a bath after many weeks.  Last night, for the first time in 37 days, I slept without any shoes on.  Moreover, for the first time in 37 days, I removed my clothing and slept in my silk sheets.  I did not sleep on the naked ground, but upon a litter.  I surely felt grand this morning.  It’s the first time in weeks that I slept on top of the ground and not in a foxhole.  This morning, for the first time, I ate a hot meal (pancakes and coffee) cooked by the company kitchen.  I have been cooking my own meals during the last 37 days.  It feels good to live like a human being again, to breathe free from anxiety and uncertainty and to sleep all night without interruption and without long, unending hours of fear and anxiety waiting for the dawn to come.  But now I am feeling grand.  I am healthy.

Take good care of yourself, darling.  When I come home, I want to find a healthy wife.  I don’t say lovely because I know you are and always will be.  Do not worry about me because I am well.

I love you with all my heart.

											I am yours,

											Silvio

Happy Birthday, my darling!  Oh, if only I could profess those words today!  I would be the happiest man in the world!

How did you celebrate your birthday?  I wish you many and many more.  I wish that you celebrate every birthday in my company.  Wouldn’t it be grand to be able to enjoy ourselves on your birthday?

I am feeling well.  I have been sleeping on a cot under a pyramidal tent.  I have been eating food prepared by cooks at a table.  I’m living in luxury again.  I have not had any excitement lately.  The nights are lovely again.  The nights have been eternal nightmares for weeks.  I am living again like a human being.  I feel I regained some weight.  

From the newspapers, you read what happened down here.  I went through two campaigns in sixty days.  Moreover, I have always been with the forward troops.  I worked hard.  I am pleased with my work.  I’ve done the best I could.  I know that I did a lot of good for the boys.  I don’t even have a scratch.

I love you, my darling.

								Somewhere in the South Pacific
								July 7, 1944

My darling Annette,

I makes 29 months today since our wedding.  I have spent nearly 27 of those months overseas!  It is not fair!  I am glad to say that today I am not only able to remember this date, but also to write about it.   A month ago at this time, I thought my time had come to pay my debt and go back into eternity.  I remembered the date even though the circumstances were trying.

I was caught in the thick of it.  The Japs threw everything they had at me.  I do not exaggerate in saying that more than a dozen artillery shells burst within a radius of ten yards from me.  Some came so near that I had dirt fall upon me.  The machine gun and rifle bullets continued their sinister whistling only a few feet from me, sometimes only a few inches above me.  That day they were after my scalp and in a big way.  I was under fire all day, but twice within two hours, they kept dropping their projectiles so near me that I came out untouched, unscratched, and unhurt only by a miracle.  Sure I am lucky.  And you too! 

Don’t be bitter, but be thankful that your prayers were exhausted.  Don’t be disappointed because I am not able to come home yet, but be thankful that I am well.  I had a hard time.  I have suffered from hunger and thirst.  I suffered from hunger because I was too tired to prepare my own meal.  In the jungle, it’s every man for himself when it comes to eating and digging a foxhole to sleep.  The time is limited and a doctor has to take care of other people.  I have given advice and advised treatment while eating, cooking, digging a foxhole and even while doing other natural functions.  

I have calluses on my hands.  I have been digging a hole into the rock every night.  It’s only during the last ten days that I have been sleeping on a cot under a waterproof tent surrounded by a mosquito net.  This may look bad to you.  To me, it is like living in luxury.  I have slept in a foxhole half full of water.  I have fallen asleep many times all soaked from head to toe.  I have had my back and buttocks sore and tender from lying down on cold, hard rocks for hours and hours.

The Japs have tried to get my scalp in the worst way.  They strafed me with their Zeros.    They bombed me with their big bombers.  They hit near me, but not near enough to hurt me.  They harassed me all night long for more than one night from dusk to dawn.  I never experienced nor knew that the nights could be so long.  Many times, it seemed as if the dawn would never come. 

They even raided the place I was lying in.  The came up to a few yards from my foxhole and lay there.  Somebody took care of them.  One day I had a Jap killed only four yards from the place where I stood.  I was fixing a compound fracture and giving plasma to one of my patients when my bodyguard killed a Jap who was trying to sneak up on us twelve feet from me.  They threw everything they had at me: artillery shells, mortar shells, machine gun and rifle bullets, knee mortar shells, not to speak of Ack- Ack shells.  Your prayers protected me.  Don’t think that I was not scared.  The Jap battle cry made cold chills run up and down my spine many times.  Their mortar shells made my legs shiver more than once and their artillery made me think that my hour had come.

Am I lucky!  I came out of it without a scratch.  Do not think that I did not have to work.  I have saved many, many lives.  I have worked for days without much rest and saved more than one man during those nightmare nights.  I feel that I have done my duty to the best of my ability with the means available.  I have suffered from hunger and thirst.  I have gone a whole day on a pint of water.  My lips were parched and my mouth dry that night.  I dreamed of running streams, ice cream, milkshakes, and cool Coca-Cola.  I suffered from hunger because I was too tired to eat and did not have time to eat.  I was too busy.  Life is more important and pressing than hunger.

I am well fed now.  I have all the water to drink.  I can take a bath daily.  I went for weeks without washing and shaving!  I smelled like a skunk!  It’s a sad story.  But that’s life.

I am feeling well and love you very, very much.  I have some time now to dream, to daydream, long, and yearn for the time I’ll be able to come home to you.

Meanwhile, I love you.


										I am yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I was very happy to receive your photos.  I was starving to see a picture of you smiling.  I like it.  I love it.  You are very pretty and lovely.  I was missing your smile for such a long time.  Oh, I wish I could kiss your lips, smell your hair, put my arms around your shoulders.  I feel something melting in me.  I want to come home.  I know we’ll be very happy.  I know it because I love you and you love me.

											7 P.M.

I was interrupted.  I was invited to go down to the beach to take a bath and have a swim in the blue sea.  I did not take a plunge into the sea, but walked around and looked at the places where I had to sweat blood and run and hide and fight for my life.  I saw the places where I worked so hard that I reached a state of exhaustion.

It was all quiet today.  The day was bright with sunlight and a gentle breeze was blowing from the sea.  It was pleasant.  The smell of death was gone.  It felt good to walk free from worry.

It’s getting darker and darker.  I’d better quit for the time being.  I’ll dream of you all night tonight.  

I do love you with all my heart.  Goodnight, darling.

I had a good sleep.  I was undisturbed.  No noise.  No firing.  No work.  I dreamed I had come home.  It was good to be back home.  It was all like a dream.

No, darling, I am sorry but I am still here.  So far, I do not have a hope to leave.  I have asked my superior officers so many times that they are tired of hearing about it.  I’ll keep on.  I’ll never get tired of asking.  I’ll only be more and more insistent as time goes on.  

I am regaining the weight I lost.  The food is as usual.  It’s plentiful as far as I am concerned.

A few minutes ago, I received the letter you wrote June 20.  By now, you know why I could not write to you for nearly a month.  I was not only too busy, but also I had no hope and no way to mail a letter.

This morning, I got up as soon as the daylight was strong enough to see.  I washed, shaved, and went to breakfast.  This consisted of a cup of coffee, toasted bread, bacon, and mush.  I had butter and jam with my toast.  As you can see, it is not bad.

Since I came to the Southwest Pacific, I have been drinking a lot of coffee.  I even take it in the evenings.  I developed a liking for it.  It helps to give me some pep.  Sometimes, I have been so tired that I needed a cup of coffee to give me strength.

I know that at home the weather is beautiful now.  Maybe it’s too hot for you.  I am used to it now.  I forgot how it feels to be cold with freezing temperatures.

I have to interrupt my writing now. I have to take care of sick call.

I love you, darling.

											All my love,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

It’s five o’clock in the afternoon.  I just had supper.  It consisted of spaghetti, corn, and bread and jam.  I drank a cup of coffee.  On my way back to my tent, I smoked a cigarette, then brushed my teeth.

I am sitting on my footlocker which I received this noon.  I have not seen it since the middle of April, three months ago.  I saw again the picture that you sent me two years ago next fall.  I like it better than the one I received two days ago.  I like to see you smiling.

After sick call today, it started to rain.  I passed my time reading periodicals and newspapers and a book on tropical diseases.  I have received the New York Times you sent me.  But, darling, you did not send all that I want.  I would like you to send me the Magazine plus the Week in Review and the Book Review.  The Week in Review keeps me abreast of what is going on in the world.  It has many articles that I enjoy reading and very good maps.  I have been reading it for years.  I really missed it.  I was a little bit disappointed in not finding it in your package.  The Book Review has kept me informed about books published in the United States.  As you know, I like literature, history, and philosophy.  I always found articles that gave me food for thought.  I consider myself an intellectual with a sound, broad classical and philosophical background.  The Book Review helped me to keep in touch with that world in which I lived for years during my college education.

I received today two letters, one of June 7 and the second of June 21.  I’ll never forget the former date.  The d_____ Japs were after my scalp in a big way that day!  I do not exaggerate that that day I myself neutralized their efforts in a big way.  I made most of their efforts to destroy us futile by helping and giving back life to the wounded men.

I have a flag that I will send you soon.  This is the only souvenir I got.  I have not cared for a fan.  They all smell Jap.  I have not seen one that appealed to me. 

Your bet about my whereabouts, you know by now, has not been wrong.  I can’t tell you where I am.  The papers and the radio tell you what you want to know.

Paul is lucky.  So far, he has had everything going his way.  But somebody has to do the hard work.  We have to win the war and somebody has to do the hard work.

I don’t know about my chances to go home.  I keep my fingers crossed, hoping for the best.  This is the only thing I can do.

Today we had a rain storm.  I collected enough water to take a bath.  This is what I’ll do as soon as I finish this letter.  Then, I’ll go to the next tent to listen to the news from San Francisco.  I have been in contact with the world at large during the past week through the radio.  It’s certainly a change for the better to be able to listen to music and some people talking from a peaceful land.

It’s raining again.  The tic tac of the rain on the tent bring back memories of old days...

I wish I could kiss and hug you now as I did then.

I cannot tell you, darling, how much I love you.


								With love, I am yours,


								Silvio

										Southwest Pacific
										July 19, 1944

My darling Annette,

I have not heard from you during the last five days.  I was spoiled.  I got one or two letters daily for a while.  I am not complaining.  

I would like to know how you passed your birthday and how you are getting along with the hot summer weather.  I have not suffered from the heat for quite a while.  It keeps on raining every day.  The sky has been cloudy.  I have not seen the sun for more than a week.  I don’t regret it.  Everything is wet, but the temperature is even.  I don’t think that there is a variation of more than 10 or 15 degrees between day and night.  It makes life more bearable.

Since my last letter, I have kept myself busy doing various chores.  I have been taking care of my professional work as usual.  In my free time, I have set my new house in order.  I have tried to make it as comfortable as possible.  As you know, I am sleeping in a tent.  To you, it may sound bad.  To me, it’s a great luxury to see the rain fall and not get soaking wet.

I cleaned and cleared the area where my cot is stretched of grass, roots, and dead leaves.  I removed the coral rocks and made the floor even and level.  I built a rack that holds my mosquito net upon my cot.  On top of the rack, I built a shelf where I lay my underwear and clothes.  Out of a cardboard box that used to wrap cigarettes, I made a footstool that I use as a mat.  I made a shower out of a big tomato juice can.  I built a stool and table upon which I am writing now out of a box that used to contain food rations.  I made a comfortable place to live in out of nothing.  I now have all the comforts of home.  

They are physical comforts, but I am not happy.  It’s a comfortable place to dream of a world where we are together.  In dreamland and spiritually, we have never been separated during the last twenty-seven months.  In our dreams, we have grown together, suffered together, experienced the same anxieties, loved the same love.  This is the first time that I sit down at a table and write to you since the middle of April.  I have written on my knees during that interval.

I am enjoying some more luxuries.  Last night, for the first time in three months, I slept in pajamas.  I am using one-tenth of a Jap parachute as a sheet.  You know that the parachutes are made of the best silk.  It feels grand to sleep in sheets again.

I came back from supper.  I ate macaroni, tomato sauce, bread with jam, and a cup of coffee.  I guess that you’ll be surprised to read that I drink coffee.  I have been drinking it at breakfast for more than a year.  I am drinking it every time I get a chance since the last campaign.  It was the only nourishment that I took for supper more than once.  I didn’t have time to cook my meals or was too exhausted to desire anything else but a cup of warm coffee.

Lately, I have been reading a few books.  I have read “Guadalcanal Diary” and am now reading “Wind, Sand and Stars” by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.  I enjoyed the first book more for the style than the content.  The author had a picnic compared to what I went through.  I have experienced all the emotions he described very well and some more.

Remember me to Mother, Auntie, and Uncle.  I’m dreaming of happy days ahead.  I am in love with you.



											Yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I’m sorry that you had to worry so much when I was sitting down comfortably.  When you wrote your last letter of June 28 that I received, I was resting, sleeping long hours undisturbed, and eating fairly well.

By now, I hope you know that it was practically physically impossible to write to you during the campaign.  My previous letters have given you a hint of my personal experiences.  It’s all over now, so why worry?

I got paid a few days ago.  I sent you $200.  It’s up to you how much you want to use of it for your birthday present.  I’m sorry I could not send it earlier or at the proper time, but war is war.  The only thing I can say is that I hope that next year I’ll be able to be at home.

Since my last letter, my life has been an easy one and quite comfortable.  I have known all the comforts of home: a good bed protected against mosquitoes, a table, a shower, and enough water to wash and drink.  The food recently has been excellent, as good as I ever ate in the Army.  I have regained all the weight I lost.  

I am not so pleased with the mail lately.  It has not come as it used to a couple of weeks ago.

I have kept my mind busy by reading.  I’ve read a few books during the daytime.  I don’t have any light so I can’t read at night.  I go to bed early, soon after sundown.  

I have a lot of time to dream of the happy days that we’ll have and to regret all this precious time that we are losing, being far from each other.  Uncle Sam is not fair to his nephews.  He spoils some and exploits the majority to the utmost.

I don’t know how my chances are to come home.  I’ll stick it out a little bit longer.  Then I’ll play sick.  My conscience is telling me that I have done more than my part.

I love you very much.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I consider today as a kind of birthday for us.  It was seven years ago today that I was first introduced to you.  It was the first time that I saw you, that I liked you and felt an indescribable attraction toward you.  Seven years is a long time.  We had our ups and downs.  But nobody will steal from us the heavenly times we had together many and many times.  The future, I hope, will treat us well.  The “down” cycle in our lives should come to an end and the “up” cycle of life should start.

In my letter of May 22, I wrote you that I did not know what the future had in store for me.  I was then on the eve of a new campaign.  I knew I was going to be on the battle front again.  I was anxious and afraid of an unknown future.  Though the future then held many hardships in store for me, I am thankful that it did not deprive me of the pleasure to see the light of the sun, to breathe, and to enjoy reading your letters.  I don’t say that it could deprive me of the feeling of deep love I have toward you because not even death will stop it or diminish it.

I cannot tell you where I am.  It’s a military secret.  You are right.  I am in the Southwest Pacific.  There is a battle going on in the Central Pacific.  Do not worry!  I’m not in it.  It’s thousands of miles away from here.

Yesterday, I received a lot of your letters.  The last one was dated July 12, 1944.  I have written often after June 17.  I wrote you every time I had a chance.  You know that when bullets are whistling overhead and pressing work has to be done, nobody feels like writing.

Tell Mother not to worry.  She is still young and she will be able to see her nephews and maybe get tired of them.

I read that you have been losing weight.  Do’t try to starve yourself to lose a few pounds.  You know that I love you to be a little bit chubby.  I just cannot stand a woman who is only bones.  Probably this is the reason why the Aussies never impressed me.  It’s a good idea to lose some weight.  I think that what you weigh now is your right weight.  Don’t try to lose any more.

Recently, I had an experience that it’s funny to talk about, but it was not funny when it happened.  I had been in the jungle for a few days.  I had taken with me only the bare necessities: some food, a poncho, and some drugs.  I went into an area and dug my hole.  I can’t tell you what kind of hole.  It’s a military secret.  It’s a place where I feel comfortable during the dark hours of the night even though the stones hurt my back and head.  I feel secure in a foxhole.  I dug one, a good one.  I’m an expert in this work.  I have dug so many.  I owe my life to them.  I had dug my hole and placed my poncho over it to keep the rain away.  One day, it started to rain at one o’clock in the afternoon.  At two o’clock, it was still raining.  At three, it was pouring.  During the first two hours, I felt secure and I was sure I was not going to get wet.  By 3:30 the walls of my hole started to ooze.  Ten minutes later, they started to leak.  By four o’clock, a stream was running in my foxhole.  Yes, in my foxhole, which is my living room, my kitchen and my bedroom in relation to the hour of the day.  I thought I was going to swim in my hole.  I got the idea to bale out the water with my helmet.  Do you know that it kept me busy for more than one hour and that I baled out more than 200 gallons of water?  The bottom of the hole was wet and muddy, but I had no choice.  I could not be fussy.  I slept in it for a few hours and waited for the coming of the dawn of another day for many long, eternal hours.

I’ll tell you about my experiences as I go along and as I remember them.

Now, I’m sitting in my tent.  I’m comfortable.  I had a good meal and feel in good health.  However hard a time I have, I always feel well.

I’ve done my washing today.  It took me an hour’s work: a few socks, a couple of shorts, my jungle suit.

My darling Annette, until next time I am all yours.

I love you very, very much.

My darling Annette,

I got just now your letter of July 16 and Father’s of July 20.  He wrote a v-mail.  Why don’t you write me a v-mail letter once in a while?  They come in a shorter time.  Father told me he received my v-mail letter of June 27.  I hope you got yours the same day.

It’s pitiful to keep you worrying about me while I am living peacefully on this island.  I have not had any excitement for a long time.  Life is monotonous again and with plenty of time to dream and to complain about life in the Army.  I do my part in complaining.  One of my men told me that he was worried about me because for a couple of days I did not complain.  That was when the going was tough and to be or not to be was a question of seconds.

I am glad that I could take it as a man.   But, darling, it was really hell.  You asked me if I ever prayed.  Not in the sense you mean, but as a scared child who cries and begs for his life.  I had to shorten my prayers.  The time was too short.  This is what I said while the Jap artillery was dropping shells a few yards in front, behind, and on the side of me.

	Pater noster, sanctificetur nomen tuum
	Fiat voluntas tua
	Sicut in caelo et in terra
	Demitte nobis debita nostra

I guess I have a fatalistic tendency.  The words “Fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra” have been the words I usually preferred during the night, during the long, eternal nights when the Japs jabbered and threw everything they had at us.

Don’t think for a second that I am afraid of the Japs.  I respect them and do not take any chances.  So far, every time I came in contact with them, I witnessed one Jap defeat after another.  There were times when one of our boys was worth 109 Japs.  It’s incredible but it’s a fact.  The Japs, the sons of heaven, the supermen of the Orient, don’t have a chance with our men on equal terms.

I’m sorry to say that I’ll be here for the time being.  Don’t worry about me.  I eat well, sleep fairly well.  This week I saw a movie for the first time in four months.  I saw the picture “True to Life.”  I enjoyed it.

I’m taking care of my daily duties.  These are light and short.  I have a lot of time to myself.  I read a great deal for hours at a time.  I read a few books lately, light fiction like “Starbuck.”  I don’t know if you read the book.  It’s the story of a pianist.  I would say it’s a chronicle of the life of a successful artist.  The book talks a great deal about the happenings of his life.  It’s not deep.  It does not give a great and clear picture of the soul of the artist.  But here I cannot be choosy.  The books are few.  I was promised some more.  Now I am reading “The Pastures of Heaven” by John Steinbeck.  I think he has a complex, a neurotic subconsciousness that takes pleasure in describing the weak, the suffering, the deficiency of life and society.

A couple of days ago I sent you a letter.  It’s a letter with a sign “Restricted.”  I have not put any words in it.  I sent you a document that I would like you to read and keep.  It’s the official document of my decoration.  Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  I have been decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in action against the enemy.  The paper will tell you what I did to deserve the decoration.  I hope you’ll be proud of it.  Please keep it until the next time.  

I’ll be loving you day and night, rain or sunshine, Japs or no Japs and hoping to be sent to you.


											I love you.

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I hope that by the time you receive this letter you’ll be quite at ease.  You have been suffering and worrying while I was enjoying the summer climate of this now peaceful island.  I have written you often and written you many long letters.

Nowadays, life is so normal and monotonous that only little things make headlines in my daily life.  I told you I have seen a picture, the first in four months.  There will be another one tonight.  At noon today, I ate ice cream for the first time in six months.  This is something!  To be able to eat ice cream in the Southwest Pacific in a place that was thick jungle only a few weeks ago!

I’m glad you took the car out.  It does help it to have it running after a year and a half.  I am wondering if I’ll be able to use it.  I hope to come home this year, but I am starting to have my doubts.  So far, they have not sent any medical officers home.  You know now why I have been so blue.  I’ll take it a little bit longer, then I’ll bust.

I have a favor to ask you.  I would like you to write me how much it costs you to put the car on the road again.  I do not like indefinite statements.  Please tell me how much you spent or do not mention it at all.  I don’t like to guess when it comes to things that are definite.  This is not intended as a reproach.  I just do not like vague statements of things that you definitely know.

No, I don’t hate you because I know that you are suffering as much as I am and because I think that mental suffering is much worse than physical suffering.  There is nothing more agonizing than the waiting, be it a day, an hour, or a second.  I had seconds that seemed never to end.  They were longer than hours and days.

No, I don’t hate you people at home.  It’s a relief to think that you and my folks don’t have to worry about the terrors of war like so many millions in Europe.  I am only angry when I read about people at home abusing the freedom we are fighting to preserve.  Yes, it’s a disappointment to hear people at home arguing and calling names because of differences of thought, religion, etc.

I guess this is not such a pleasant letter.  I’m in a bad mood today.  One of my men tried to tell me how to run my unit.  That is as far as he went.  He tried.  There is always somebody who thinks he knows everything.  It does not take me long to put them in their place.

Remember me to your people.  I love you and think of you often.  You know that you are my pin-up girl.  I don’t think there is a better girl in the whole world.
										I love you.

My darling Annette,

Another Sunday, another week gone.  I just talked to a man who is going home on rotation.  I asked him what he did to get such a break.  I am ready to do anything to go home.  I did good things and these didn’t get me anywhere.  I guess I should try spitting at my superior officers and kicking them in the shin.  Maybe that way they would get rid of me!  I have to try something radical.  I don’t give a damn whatever happens.  My conscience does not bother me anymore.  I feel that I have done my duty and got no breaks.

I’m lucky I got some books to read.  Otherwise, I would become a perfect neurotic.  The life is too quiet now.  My work is over in an hour every day.  I have a lot of time to myself and long, eternal nights to vegetate.

I thank you for mentioning the Betty Smith book, “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.”  I finished it yesterday.  I read it very slowly and carefully.  It’s well written and true to life.  I found a mistake here and there about the times in which the people in the book lived.  For instance, in 1913, Johnny and Francie were talking about trolley cars and why people should pay fares.  Francie could not understand that.  So her father told her that they were not living in Russia where people own everything because of socialism.  Funny that in 1913, Russia was still under the Czar and the people were still serfs.  Aside from this, I found the book true to life, moving at places, exciting in others, occasionally dramatic.  Those people are living.  I know them now as if they were my acquaintances.  Katie is really a noble picture of a mother.  I don’t recall having read any other book with the exception of Gorky’s “Mother” where a mother is better described and exalted.  The children remind me of my childhood and the childhoods of all children.

As I told you, my life is very monotonous now.  I happened to have regained all the weight I lost.  I feel well and I should not complain.  But I get so homesick and crave so much to be sent home that I guess some day I’ll bust.

Soon, I’ll start my 29th month of service overseas and the so and sos don’t give me a chance to go home.  This life makes me bitter.  So far, I don’t have a chance for promotion because the table of organization doesn’t require more Majors than we have.   I cannot hope to go home because they need doctors badly.  But some day I’ll fool them even if I have to go nuts to do it.  I’m getting plainly desperate and I don’t give a damn who knows it.

Now I am reading “Burma Surgeon” by Dr. Seagrave.  I am having some fun.

Oh!  How I wish I could kiss you.  I love you with all my heart and soul and I’ll be home someday to realize my dreams cost what it will cost.
								I love you.			Silvio

My darling Annette,

Your letter of August 2 came in record time.  It took only twelve days to come to me.  It is a real surprise!  I had to tell everybody.  I hope that the service from me to you is as speedy.

It’s Sunday afternoon.  It’s raining, not hard as it usually does.  It’s all quiet around.  Everybody is in his tent, sleeping or reading.  Sunday is a real day of rest.  I can sleep an hour longer.  This morning I was awakened by the sunlight in my face.  I wondered where I was when I opened my sleepy eyes.  The bright light was so strong and so blinding.

I do not have anything to tell you.  My life is monotonous once again.  I do my daydreaming about you, but I still have a lot of time to myself.  I have seen a picture in our area.  It’s a good picture.  I was disappointed with the sound.  I have played pinochle at night.  So far, I am even.  I have won as many games as I lost.  It’s fair, don’t you think?  

My daily chores are not strenuous, nor long.  I enjoy them and like them.  However, I have a lot of time left free from duties.  I have been reading book after book.  I read a book about typhus.  Now I’m reading “The Horse and Buggy Doctor.”  It’s an autobiography by Dr. Hertzler.  It helps me to recall my own experiences.  Even though I never used a buggy or a horse, the human part of the book is always the same.  Medicine has not changed much during the last fifty years.

I’m sorry about your aunt.  She certainly is clinging to life.

I’m happy to hear the glad tidings the war in Europe is bringing us.  I usually listen to the news at 7 P.M. from San Francisco.  Then, it’s 5 A.M. in Lowell and I don’t think very practical to listen to the news when you can get the same news at breakfast time.

By the way, do you still sleep until the last second and then rush through breakfast to work?  

I like to recall that seven years ago, I was trying my best to get a date with a lovely young girl.  It took her a few days to make up her mind, but finally she condecended and one of the happiest evenings of my life was the result.  I wish I were back to seven years ago and could start anew, minus the ripples that life has brought to irritate me.

Tomorrow, I start my 29th month overseas!  It’s a shame!  What kind of war is this?  Do you think the people are human?  I have my doubts.

							I love you.			Silvio

My darling Annette,

As I start to write this letter, I “kind of feel” guilty.  During the week, I have received many of your letters and today I got the New York Times and these sheets of paper.  Your letter of August 9 reached me and also some letters you wrote previously.  I know I should have written at least twice since my last letter on Sunday.  I can’t tell you how quickly the week passed.  I intended to write many times, but something always came in the way.  

At the beginning of the week, I wrote a lecture that I have given already.  It took a long time to write it.  It was very important that the boys learned what I spoke of.  It took me many hours of writing, correcting and rewriting.  Then came the practicing.  I had to read it a few times to myself and place the emphasis where it belonged.  I think that I put it across fairly well.  At least I have not seen anybody fall asleep during my lecture.

The week that comes to an end has been pleasant.  I guess it was the most pleasant one since I landed three months ago tomorrow.  One day I took a long ride in a jeep.  I rode for two hours, visiting different places, all the while remembering what I saw where peace now reigns.  It was a pleasure to be able to ride at 60 miles per hour instead of walking at 2 1/2 miles per hour.  It’s funny that I covered in two hours what took two weeks of walking!  I saw beautiful scenery.  I saw scenes that I am not able to describe, not because I can’t, but because I am not allowed. 

I have been busy too.  I’m running a small hospital by myself.  I have a few patients.  I like it and get a lot of satisfaction.

Two events occurred during the week that deserve mention.  I saw and heard Judith Anderson and her entourage.  She played an act from “Macbeth.”  She is a great actress and artist.  I enjoyed it.  I don’t have to tell you that she did not receive the credit she was due.  How can people who do not have a high school education understand Shakespeare?  What do we care about tragedy when we saw so much of it?  The poet is great.  But he succeeds in only attempting to describe and transmit to us real tragedy.  The tragedy we saw is real.  I lived it.  Other artists played music or sang.  The violinist was excellent and the singer was sweet and had a golden voice.  I loved to hear them both.  To me it was an enjoyable evening.

Last night I saw Bob Hope and had a hearty laugh at his numerous funny jokes.  He certainly can put a joke across.  He is liked by everybody.

As you see, life is not bad.  As you may conclude by yourself, there is no danger to worry about when I can indulge in classical music and comedy, the best that Uncle Sam can afford.

I finished reading “The Horse and Buggy Doctor.”  I enjoyed the book.  It refreshed memories of my own practical experiences.  I do not agree with some of the author’s conclusions.  I think he is old and not conscious of what is going on today.

Can you guess what I am reading now?  I am reading “The Republic” of Plato.  So far, I am getting great pleasure from it.  I do not want you to misunderstand me, but I have used many times many of the arguments the author described or narrates.  I do not agree with everything he says, however.  I’ll tell you more about the book when I finish it.

I wish I could be home and nurse your cold.  I could get you well overnight!

I am still trying my best to get a trip home.  It looks as if the doctors are the members of the exploited profession and the most neglected one.  How long shall I wish and yearn and dream of being with you?  I am tired of dreams.  I want to be with you and love you and live with you.  It would be only time...

I had to interrupt.  It was chow time or dinner to you.  It was not so good: potatoes, lentils and bacon.  It was nourishing.  I am cutting down on my eating.  I am getting too fat.

Remember me to your mother and aunt.

I love you with all my heart.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I am very pleased with the mail service.  I just got your letter of August 13.  It came in 13 days.  It’s very good.

I’m sorry you are suffering from a cold.  I wish I could be able to nurse and care for you.  It hurts me to think that you have to suffer without my help.  I’m sure I could help you.  I know that colds are very severe in the summertime, not for the consequences, but for the suffering they cause.  I’m thankful that I have not known what a cold is since the one I had at Little Rock.  I have not had any illness, not even a cold.

I don’t agree with you about the temperature.  I think and know that it’s warmer at home than it is here.  So far, the temperature has been very good, not higher than 85 degrees.  The nights are always cool.  I sleep with a blanket and occasionally I need two, especially in the early morning.

I include a picture of myself and some of the men who have known me for a long time.  They were taking a picture when I happened to pass by.  They invited me to take a group picture.  I was in a grand mood.  The war was forgotten and I felt good.  I wanted to send you a picture of myself smiling.  This is it.  I like it because it is natural and taken on the spur of the moment.  

I am well.  I have some work to do, more than usual, now that my assistant is sick.  He is resting at the hospital.  He has been sick three times already during his service overseas.  I don’t think he can take it as well as I can.

I saw a picture last night “Gaslight.”  I liked it.  It has first class acting. Do you remember  how we liked to see Boyer’s pictures?  

I am still reading Plato’s “Republic.”  I understand now why the book has been a bestseller and read the most during the past 24 centuries.

I love you, darling.  I wish I could tell you when I’ll come home.  If I could, I would start at this very second.  

I have in my tent Father Hathaway from Nashua.  He knows your uncle.  He’s a grand guy!


											I love you.

My darling and beloved Annette,

I’m sorry you have not received any mail from August 9-19.  I have been writing you often.  I have not let a week go by without writing you a letter.  I guess the mail has a hard time to go back to the States.  I’m getting yours quite regularly.  I have made a point to answer each letter you send me as I receive it.  For instance, I got your letter of August 19 just a moment ago.

I have interrupted my reading of “Jane Eyre” by Charlotte Bronte.  I have not gone far yet.  I only read 50 pages.  I have changed from heavy “stuff” to lighter ones.  I had great pleasure, however, in reading “The Making of the Mind.”  It’s a history of the progress of man’s mind.  In “Jane Eyre” I appreciate the style and clarity of expression.  I already agree with the commentator in considering it a classic of English literature.

From this letter and my previous ones, you may well come to the conclusion that my life is not a hard one.  A tired body cannot read, especially heavy material.

It’s now the middle of the afternoon of a beautiful tropical day.  It’s warm, but a gentle breeze is blowing.  It’s lovely now.

I’m taking care of my usual work.  Do not worry about the money.  I believe that the delay is due to the great amount of money being sent by our men.  I sent it by telegram.  I should have sent it by a money order.   But then, about a month ago, the post office was not yet opened or functioning.

Last night, I saw another movie.  I already forgot the title!  

I wish to be with you as much as you want to be with me.  My fellow officers tell me that I am “bitter” when I complain about the rotation plan.   My answer is that they are darn right that I am deeply, thoroughly bitter.  This, however, does not keep me from loving you with all my heart.  I dream often of being on my way home!  When it will come to be a reality I do not know.  I hope soon.

Thank you for the New York Times.  I have not received it yet.

										I love you.
