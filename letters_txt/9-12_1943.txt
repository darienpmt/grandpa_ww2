										September 7, 1943

My darling Annette,

I agree with you that the mail service has been slackening since I came back from New Guinea.  I have been without receiving a letter from you for a long week.  I was worried this morning and inquired about the mail many times.  Finally, this evening I received two letters from you: a v-mail of August 24 and an air mail letter of August 17.  I feel at ease now.  

I am sorry for your aunt.  I hop you enjoyed your trip to Canada though it was not under favorable circumstances.  By now, I guess you are back at home.

My life is as usual.  I’m doing the same kind of work.  I was promised to be sent to school.  I do not know when or where.  I am sure of one thing: that it will not be in the United States and that is very disappointing.  

I have played golf a few times.  I missed it this Sunday because of the rain.  It poured all day.  

So far, all my enjoyment has been from going to the movies.  I have seen all the movies in town every week.  I am getting tired of it.

I have changed your allotment.  It should become effective starting October 1.  Maybe you will not get it before November 1.  I changed it to $260. a month.  I have accumulated some money here that I am going to send you.  I’ll send it as soon as I can.  I figure to send you $200.  I am keeping a few dollars that I want to spend during my coming leave.

I can get a week’s leave whenever I want.  It will be my first leave since I came overseas.  I don’t know where to go.  I am undecided.  I would like to go inland to visit the big cattle stations or go east to the islands and see one of the wonders of the world or go to visit one of the Australian cities that I have not visited yet.  I do not think that I’ll take it this month.

I’ll have been out of New Guinea for eight weeks soon.  I have had no trouble yet.  Thank goodness!  I stopped taking Atabrine 25 days ago.  I have checked and rechecked my blood for malaria.  I am all right.

Do not go through hardship and suffer from hunger trying to lose weight.  I like you and love you as you are and I do miss you tremendously.  There is only one girl in the whole world that I love and that’s you, my beloved.  I am looking forward and dreaming of the day when I’ll be back home with you.  I have been dreaming so long and wishing it so much that it must come true someday.  We must have our silver lining someday.  The war is going our way and my hopes are brighter than they have ever been before.

It has been a dreary day.  It rained part of the day.  It’s unusual because here it does not rain much during this period of the year.  Quite a difference from New Guinea!

I am still working hard at my phonetics.  I get discouraged sometimes, but I keep up and I’ll have some visible improvement by the time I come back home.

I love you and am all yours.


										Silvio

P.S.	I am sending you a kiss for every word I read daily.  I adore you.

My darling Annette,

I have received your letter of August 24, the one you wrote on your way to Canada.  I know very well how you felt when you wrote it.  It reminded me of the night we arrived in Houston, Texas.  I wish we were back there!

Within a couple of hours, I take a train and go to school.  It will be a change and will keep my mind busy for a dozen days.  I am going to a city five hundred miles to the south.  

Yesterday, I saw and heard the First Lady.  She gave a short talk that was indeed a hearty message from our President.  I like her.  She has been very well received and is the talk of the town.  I think she is doing wonderful work.  She is giving a lift to the morale of the men and she helps us tremendously in building a feeling of good will with the Aussies.

I’ll write you as soon as I settle in the new place.  Meanwhile, I send you all my love.  

I am all yours and always thinking of you.

My darling Annette,

As I suspected, I am in school, not in the United States, but in Australia.  I have been at this school since Sunday noon.  I was in the classroom a few hours after I arrived.  I am working hard, but I like it.  It’s a novelty and a change that helps to lift my morale.  

I am living in a beautiful home located in surroundings similar to those of our home in New Rochelle.  It’s spring here and the trees are in bloom.  It reminds me of the few days we passed in Shelton, but you are not here.  The scenery, the climate, and the sky are the same, but what a difference.  I am lonesome.  I miss you all the time, not only a few hours a day as I used to.

Yesterday afternoon, I went down and had a picture taken.  It will be ready within six weeks!  Saturday, I’ll see the proofs.  I am in one of the big Aussie cities.

I am enjoying good meals, the best food I have eaten since I have been in Australia.  It’s really well cooked and plentiful.  

I already had one exam.  I made 90.  Tomorrow I have another.  I hope I have the same luck.  

Have a kiss for every word I hear during the day that consists of 8 hours of lectures.

I love you and adore you.  I am all yours body and soul.

My darling and beloved Annette,

I have not received any mail from you for the past 12 days.  I am anxious to go back to camp and read your mail.  

I am still, as you may guess, at school.  I am working hard and burn the midnight oil every night until early morning.  Do you remember Carlisle?  It is something like that, but you are not with me and that is everything.  They keep us very busy, so much that I do not have time to enjoy the spring.  Today it’s the first day of spring and it’s warm for a change.  I’d feel like going swimming during the day if I had the time. 

A few minutes ago, I had supper.  I’ll take it easy for a while.  Then, I’ll study for the examination that I have tomorrow morning.  

How are you, darling?  Have you had a good trip to Canada?  How is everybody at home?   

I am sorry that the school will be over soon.  Two more days to go.  Do you know that my mind wandered back to Lowell during the lectures?

I am looking forward to the time when I’ll be back with you.  Meanwhile, have all my love.  I adore you.


									All yours,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

Tonight I do not study.  I don’t have any assignments for tomorrow.  The school is closed tonight.  The course ended this afternoon with a final exam.  I came out all right even though it was a tough one.  A few did not pass.  

I can’t tell you how I feel.  I miss you and need you to share this with me.  We could celebrate tonight and be very happy together.  I wish we were back together in Carlisle, but we are so far away.  I hope this war will come to an end soon and we can be reunited.

I am waiting for transportation to go back to camp.  It will take me twenty hours by train and I dread it.  It’s a long trip.  The train is slow, uncomfortable, jerking, and shaking.  It stops every few miles and it’s cold at night.

I am glad this course is over.  It was a tough one and many did not make the grade.  Last night and many nights before, I had to stay up until midnight to study.  I know I learned a great deal.  I enjoyed the food that was excellent all the way through and enjoyed sleeping in a bed with a pillow and sheets.

I am in a hurry to be back, even though I told you that I dread the trip, because I am eager to read your mail.  I have not received any news for the last two weeks.  It seems to be a century.

The news of the war is good.  I have listened to the news daily.  It makes my heart jump with joy to hear that the war is going our way.  It will never be too soon for me because I am anxious and eager to be back with you.  

How is your mother?  How did she take the trip?  I hope you are back by now.

Have you heard from my folks?

Have you received the increased allotment?  If you didn’t, don’t worry because it may take more than a month.  I was going to send you some money, but I did not have the chance.  I’ll send it to you as soon as I can.

A kiss for every word I heard during the last two weeks in class.
I love you, darling.


									All yours,

My darling Annette,

After a long and tedious journey, I finally arrived in camp last night.  The first thing I did was to look for the mail.  Thank you, darling.  I found all your letters from August 26 to September 14.  I had not heard from you for sixteen long days.  It did irritate me to have to wait for transportation at different points.  You have no idea how tiresome it is to travel in these slow, always stopping trains.  They shake, tremble, vibrate, and jerk.  My neck and back are still hurting me.  I feel very tired even though I had an excellent night of sleep last night.

I am back to camp now, performing the usual routine.  I’ve had enough school for a while.  I’ll be able to teach what I learned.  I am glad to be back.  It makes me awfully lonesome to be in a large city where I see so many people happily moving around and having a good time.  Here in camp, we are all in the same boat.  We all miss our dear ones, we all go through the same routine, sleep in the same tents and cots, and suffer the same anxieties.  In the city, instead, I saw too many people who were different from me.  The have a home, friends, and relatives.  They enjoy and love and live.  I do envy them.  It’s all this that makes me feel lonesome in a crowd.

I have not played golf because when I could it rained.  

I am sorry to disappoint you, darling, but I do not nourish any hope to become a Major.  It’s beyond my dreams.  I had my promotion and that will be enough for a long time.  I know that I am eligible for it and so are many others.  Promotions today are not only due to knowledge and capability, but to chance.  In the Medical Corps, promotions are very slow.  In my unit, we are supposed to have one Major and we have two.  Sleeter has been a Captain for two years and has today as much chance to become a Major as I have.  The Chaplain should be a Colonel.  He has been a Major for nearly three years.  He should complain.  And that goes for the Colonel too.  I should not and am not complaining because I had my break.  I know more than one man who had a life much harder than mine and had no promotion.

I have one ambition, to come home to you.  I want to come back soon and to be with you and live with you.  I want this war to come to and end and am ready to forget it.

The news has been coming in very satisfactorily and will keep on until victory is won and we will be sent home.  It will take some time, but it will come someday.  

I am glad you are back from Canada.  The next time you go there, make a study of the Army insignia of that country.  I don’t like Colonels.  

I received a letter from Tornambee.  He invited me to go to see him.  

I had a picture taken.  I’ll send it to you as soon as I receive it.

I have bought a new uniform and bought a few medical books.  I’m sorry that I spent some of the money that I had promised to send you.

I am feeling well and love you.


									I am all yours,


									Silvio

										October 5, 1943

My darling Annette,

A little while ago, I read your letters of September 16, 19 and 22.  I received them on my way back from supper.  I badly needed your news.  I needed you to lift up my morale which was very low.  Your letters are like a lift, a boost for another little while.  I think that the mail service is all right now.  A few hours ago, I thought it was awful.  I’ll be happy for a few days, a couple of days at least.

Last week, I went to the beach on duty.  I took care of the men who went swimming or horseback riding.  One fell from a horse and broke his nose and lost a few teeth.  I took care of him and then sent him to the hospital.  I was not busy all the time.  I had a long interval to pass at the beach.  I did not go swimming.  I only took a walk.  It’s a beautiful beach that compares favorably with our beaches.  The crowd was mixed with the soldiers predominant.

As I previously wrote you, I did see her and heard her talk.  It was not so far north as you think.  I guess it may be one hundred miles south of that.

You do not have to worry about me.  I am in Australia now.  I am far away from any danger, even potential danger.  I am completely recovered from my long trip.  You cannot imagine how tiresome these trains are.  They are worse than anything I ever experienced in Europe.

I am dedicating a few hours daily to my favorite pastime, phonetics, and I still find some fun out of it.

I really think you should help your mother in paying for the work done around the house.  I trust your good judgment to such an extent as to send you all the money I save.  I know that you spend it well.  I believe you when you say that your mother would appreciate it.

While at school, I tried to buy a gift for you, but everything is sky high as far as price is concerned and very cheap in quality.  A sapphire similar to the one I sent you last year costs four times what I paid.  If I go to visit Paul, I may have a better chance to find something.  If not, I’ll send you the money.  I do not see any use in buying things here that you could buy at home at a cheaper price and of the same quality and origin.  If I knew what you would like to have, I would try to get it.

I wish I were back in New England during this season of the year.  What a good time we could have!  I surely would love to keep you warm as I used to.  I’ll be satisfied to dream for the time being, but I hope that one day I’ll have you in my arms.

I kiss you many, many times.  I adore you.         			All yours,       Silvio

										October 14, 1943

My darling Annette,

I have been trying to find the time to write you since Monday.  I never had the time or when I had it, I did not feel in the mood.  I have felt in a very bad mood lately.  I do mean it when I say that I was much happier in New Guinea than I am down here.  I went to see the Colonel and asked to be transferred to a hospital unit.  I’m tired of walking around and marching up and down hills.  I gave him a piece of my mind.  I do not know how much good it will do.

The school I went to was not a medical school and of the eleven days, only half a day was dedicated to medicine.  It was a frank disappointment to me.  I do not know what to do.  I feel like starting to scream.  My disposition is getting worse and worse.  I am sorry for the fellows who have to stand me.  I hope this d_____ war will come to an end soon.  I feel I have done more than my share.

As I told you, I have increased your allotment to $260.  You should receive it next month.  Let me know if you do.  It may not be increased due to delayed mail service.  A few days ago, I sent you $200. by wire.  I hope you’ll get it by the end of the month.  How are we with our savings?  Are we coming along all right?  Have you given any money to Mother for the papering of the rooms?

I hope you do not mind my complaining.  But to whom should I complain if not to my dearest, most cherished, and loved friend in the whole world?  I do love you, darling, and I miss you so much that I cannot express it in words even if I try for years and years.

This war has been going in our favor and is steadily going in our favor.  Someday, it’ll be over and forgotten.  It will never be too soon for me.

Life is going on in the same way.  I take care of the sick and try to keep the men healthy and I am doing a good job at that.  The food is good and plentiful.  I sleep well at night.  I have checked my blood for malaria and have not found any germs.  My health is as good as can be.  I cannot complain about my health, thank goodness! 

Days ago, I was sick.  Do you remember in Fort Lewis the night I had a fever following an injection?  I had the same injection again and felt the same way.  But I did not have your moral support.  I felt miserable for a couple of days.  It’s all gone now and I feel at my best.

The cold season has come and passed.  It’s summer heat here.  I use only one blanket and sometimes none.  Yesterday, it was better than in New Guinea.  Today, it’s comfortable.

I received your telegram four days ago.  When did you send it?  I thank you.

I have not received any of your Christmas packages yet.  I am looking forward to them because I have just finished eating the candy you sent me with the concentrated soup cans.  I ate it slowly, in two months time.

Waiting for your next letter.

									I am all yours,

									Silvio

My darling Annette,

It’s Saturday evening.  I am writing in the Recreation Hall lit by electric light.  Not many men are around.  Most of them are at the movies.  This gives the place some stillness.

It was a quiet day for me.  I had no celebration, nor did anybody wish me a Happy Birthday.  Indeed, I have not told anybody that today is my birthday.  On this day, I have one wish and one thought alone.  I want and desire to be with you during this coming year of my life.  And I hope that I will be able to come back to you.  Don’t you think that they must send me back?

Today, I have not done much.  I took care of the usual work.  Being Saturday, I took a nap in the afternoon for an hour.  I listened to the radio for the news which is now very good, talked, and ate.

I do not have to tell you that I wanted you with me today.  Soon I have been overseas for 18 months.  I have not seen you for 18 months!  How many more?

How are you, my beloved wife?  I wish I could be home and keep you warm during the winter season.  Here it is starting to feel like summer.  I wish you were here because I know you would like this weather that is very good and pleasant.  The climate is wonderful, flowers are blooming, birds are singing, etc.

Have you heard from my folks?  How is Mother?  Auntie and Uncle?

I am still thinking about taking the week’s leave that belongs to me.  I may take it someday.  How I would like to spend it with you!  I don’t have to tell you.  Nothing would make me happier.

I love you.  Have millions and millions of kisses.

										I am yours,

										October 22, 1943

My darling Annette,

Yes, today it’s eighteen months since I sailed for Australia.  A year and a half.  It’s a long time in a man’s life.  I had hoped to be able to come back at the end of 18 months, but I am still here.  I am doing my work, even though my heart is not in my work.

I have a hard time with myself.  The monotony of this life is getting to me.  I try to keep my chin up and try to do my duty.  I want to come back home.  Soon, I’ll depart for a week’s leave.  I am going to take it easy for seven days.  I hope it will change my disposition.  I am going south where the climate is cooler.  It’s like summer at home here.  I’ll write you from my vacation place.

Today I saw Pepe.  He just came back.  He had a bad break, nine months in the jungle.  He is all right and the same fellow.  So it goes for Berger.  I hope to meet Paul soon.  We’ll have a few games of golf together.

I sent you $200. a couple of weeks ago.  I hope you received it by now.  That will make the number round, I mean the number you mention in your letter of October 7.

Do you know that these anniversaries make me bitter?  I compare the memory of the past, sweet and lovely to remember, with the present and I am bitter and disappointed.
Do I annoy you with my complaints?  I should feel well because I am going on a leave.  But what’s a leave to me when I won’t meet you where I am going?  It will be a change of scenery and of routine.  It will not mean happiness because I’ll only be fully and really happy when I come back home to my beloved wife and I hope for keeps.

Now that I got that off my chest, I feel better and I’ll be able to stand this muggy weather.  It’s summer here.  It’s as hot as it is in New Guinea.

How are you, darling?  How are you enjoying the golden fall?  How are Mother and Auntie and Uncle?  I am feeling healthy.  I have checked and rechecked my blood very many times and never found any malaria germs, never had any fever.  I should be thankful to God for my health.  I like and want to stay healthy because I want to be as such when I come home to you.  I want to come back to you as I was when I left you, only a little bit older with a couple of gray hairs on my temples and my hair line a little bit receded from my forehead.  You don’t mind, do you? 

I’ll love you the same, I think more, I know more, because I do.

I love you and I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I arrived here yesterday morning after having travelled for two days.  I came partly by plane and partly by train.  Both were pleasant.

I enjoyed the two-hour flight very much.  I was anxious when I left the ground.  I felt better in the air.  It’s quite an experience to fly through the clouds that look like cotton balls floating in the air.  I encountered many in the air.  I am sorry I did not take a picture because the sight was beautiful.  I flew over hills and valleys, across rivers and lakes.
I was thrilled.

I made the second part of the trip by train.  I was lucky enough to get a berth and a good companion, an elderly man who had been in public life for over 20 years.  He described the country we went through as if he were my guide.  We talked for hours.

										

										Love,

										October 28, 1943

My darling Annette,

In my previous letter, I did not have enough space to tell you that yesterday I saw Paul.  We had dinner and supper together.  He looks very good.  We had a long chat last night until midnight.  I did most of the talking.  I had many things to say.  He has a good time and a nice job.  I kind of envy him in a certain way, in another I don’t.  

After my arrival, I found a nice room where I am now writing, had breakfast, then went visiting.  A saw and walked across the beautiful, long bridge that adorns a not less beautiful harbor.  I like the city.  I would prefer warmer weather.  This morning, I went to see the university, passed a couple of hours looking through the museum of medicine, had lunch with doctors, talked a great deal, and had a pleasant time.   

I have read the daily papers and Willkie’s “One World.”  They keep my mind busy and keep me from getting too lonesome.  I do miss you.   I would have such a wonderful time if you were with me.


										I love you.

										November 3, 1943

My darling Annette,

Today is my last day in this city.  I’ll leave tonight for my camp.  It’s been a quick, fast week.  I have been very lucky and had a good time thanks to Mr. Shaw who was my guide and a fine host at the same time.  He took me for a sail in the harbor and an automobile ride to one of the fashionable beaches.  I enjoyed the sailing immensely.  It was my first experience with a sailing boat and my first visit to one of the most beautiful harbors in the world.  I enjoyed the beach party.  We had tea on the beach and a bite to eat.  The party was arranged by Mr. Shaw’s colleagues at the local university.  It was an intellectual affair.  They do have wonderful beaches with breakers as high as in California.

I have tried to buy something for you for Christmas.  I walked from store to store.  It’s hard to find anything and whatever is good is too expensive.  I could not afford this, having sent you some of my savings before I got my leave.  I did not know that I was going to get the leave so soon.  Anyhow, I bought you something that I am sure you’ll like.  It’s not showy, but useful.  I sent you a sheepskin rug.  You’ll feel warm and soft when you lay your bare feet on it.  On arrival, it will be all pressed.  Shake it a few times and you’ll see how soft it will be.  

I had a record made of my voice.  I sent you a message.  I do not know if I’ll succeed in sending it to you.  If I do, you’ll hear me talking.  I don’t know if you’ll recognize my voice.  I don’t know because this is the first time I heard my own voice.  You’ll know how much progress I have made.  I hope you do get it.  Have you received the $200. I sent you about three weeks ago?

Last night, I went to the movies for the first time since I came down here.  I liked it.  They have beautiful theaters with very soft seats.  Most of the evenings, I have been visiting or eating at different houses.  I was a guest of Mr. Shaw, Mr. Alexander, etc.  After supper, I talked or they talked and before I knew it, it was time to go to bed.  The people are very nice here.  They have treated me very well and are friendly and courteous.  

Monday night, I had supper at one of the most beautiful houses I ever saw.  It was a  high class dinner with wine, etc.  I played crochet, an old people’s game.  The hostess, an elderly lady, won against her son and myself.  It’s played in the yard with balls and wooden mallets.  I enjoyed it for once.  I do not think I would like to play it all the time.

Yesterday, I had a trip to the mountains.  I don’t like the mountains.  They are not high enough and are too flat.

I adore you and love you.

								Somewhere in Australia
								November 6, 1943


My darling Annette,

At noon today, I arrived in my tent after an absence of two weeks.  I have used all means of transportation available.  I flew for two hours and a half among the clouds over hills and valleys and rivers and lakes.  I travelled in a Pullman car called a sleeper.  I slept most of the night while the train moved on.  My companion was an elderly man of about 55, an Australian politician, who was a member of Parliament in Canberra for 20 years.   We had a long conversation that I enjoyed.  He taught me a few tricks and pointed out important or historical places on the way.  Thanks to him I saw a long road of trees in bloom.  They are beautiful.  I forget the name.  They are a sight that I’ll never forget.  The color of the flower is similar to your wedding dress.  So, you may guess where my mind wandered while I admired that natural beauty.

It took two days and a half to reach my place of vacation.  I never saw that city before.  By the way, it’s the only city on this coast that I never visited before.  I have seen all the other cities of a large size.

There I met Paul.  He looks all right.  We had many meals together and passed a couple of nights together until I started to go visiting people I met.  I went to the university because I wanted to have my voice recorded.  I met the professor who teaches phonetics.  He taught me a few points and through him I met many other teachers.  They invited me on a sailing boat trip, a ride to a beach, and to many suppers.  These people are very hospitable.  They really appreciate what we have done to defend their country.  

I bought a sheepskin rug that I hope you’ll receive before Christmas.  I know you’ll like to put your feet on it during the cold weather season.  Let me know when you receive it.

I had the surprise of my life when I heard my own voice.  I sent you the record.  I never heard myself talking before.  I don’t speak so badly.  As you’ll see, there is still room for improvement.  I have some new books that I’m going to study.  I have tried to send the record to you.  It contains my Christmas message to you.  If you get it, I hope you’ll find a gramophone from which you’ll hear me talking.

I enjoyed my vacation, enjoyed the food and the long hours of sleep.  Contrary to Army tradition, I have not drunk one teaspoonful of liquor or wine or beer.  I bought a bottle of wine, but I still have it with me.  I am going to keep it and celebrate when I hear that the King of Italy has abdicated.

I put on a couple of pounds instead of losing it.   Most of the boys drink a great deal and eat nothing.  I ate a great deal and drank nothing.  

I wanted to send you some jewelry, but it was so expensive that I could not afford it.  Have you received the last check I sent you?  By now, we have a good amount of money, don’t we?

I don’t know how many times daily I said to myself that if only you were with me, what a time we would have.  But, I look forward to it and am saving myself for those days.

I have received three packages.  Thank you.  I like everything you sent me.  I’ll treasure every article.  But, why did you send me so many flannel pajamas?  I’ll keep them for next winter.  It’s too hot to wear them, especially now.  I needed badly everything you sent me.  Tonight, I’ll wear the cotton pajamas and I am already wearing the underwear and socks.

Darling, I love you more than ever.

										I am all yours,

										November 16, 1943

My darling Annette,

I hope this time I’ll be able to write this letter to the end.  Yesterday, I started to write you a letter but I was unable to finish it.  I had to move to another place before I came to the end of the page.

I wrote you a week ago yesterday.  It was our 21 month anniversary!  I have not had a chance to sit down and write because I have been moving and running around as I used to last year.  I guess my easy days are gone and I will have some hard work to do.  I don’t mind.  I’ve had it very soft so far and can stand some hardship like walking up and down hills, sleeping on the ground, and eating in the woods.  I don’t mind it.  I think of it as if it were a picnic.

I have been back a week from my leave.  This is quite a different life from what I had in the big city.  It’s healthier, however.

I couple of days ago, I weighed myself and found that I am putting on some weight.  I am over 160 pounds.

I received the pictures and I’m going to send them to you as soon as I am back in camp.  I did not come out as clearly as I wanted.  Don’t think that I am always as serious as I am in the photo.  I was tired that day.  I had six hours of lectures that day.

I have seen Pepe and Berger.  They are all right and send you their regards.  I have not received any news from Gino for a long time.  I owe him a letter.  I’ll write him for Christmas.  I lost his address before I moved to New Guinea.

I am feeling as good s usual and as usual I am feeling homesick and lonesome though in a crowd.  I miss you and want to be back with you as strongly as ever.  I love you very much and my heart jumps at the thought that I must stay away much longer.  The only bright hope is that the war in Europe will come to an end within a few months.  Then things will ease and I hope that they will give us a chance to be sent home.  I am too healthy to be sent into a hospital.  Only men unfit for field duty are sent to work in hospitals.  Everybody can do that work.  It’s only the strongest ones who are fit to serve in the field.  I am not complaining.  I’ll do my duty and take any hardship with my chin up.

Remember me to your Mother and Auntie and Uncle.  I have not heard from Auntie for a long time.  If I do not write, she should not mind and should keep on writing because I like to hear from her once in a while.

I love you very much and I am all yours.					Silvio

My darling and beloved Annette,

This is my third attempt to write this letter.  I wrote you already two long letters, one yesterday and another a couple of hours ago.  On second thought, I considered them good reading material for the censor.  I know you share my thoughts and feelings, so I feel and think it’s better to use our telepathy and leave the censor in the dark.

I am sitting in my tent.  I lay my posterior on my footlocker made comfortable by a woolen Australian blanket.  I am writing on a rustic table built of boards that I gathered around the camp area at various intervals.  It’s not a beautiful table.  It wouldn’t adorn any studio or living room in America, but it serves its purpose very well.

I am in camp today.  Olson took my place in the field where I was for six days during Olson’s illness.

It’s a beautiful day here.  We had some rain last night, just enough to wet the grass.  It’s dry again today.  The weather is a beautiful summer day, very common in this part of Australia at this time of the year.  The sun is shining overhead in the beautiful blue sky.  It’s a warm, burning sun.  A few lazy clouds are moving sluggishly.  A soft, gentle breeze is blowing from the sea, strong enough to carry away this light paper and pleasing to relieve the heat.  It’s a summer day, a day to pass at the beach with lovely company.  But where is my lovely company?  14,000 miles away.  Oh, darling, I don’t know what I would give to be able to come home or to take you here.  I like warm weather and this gentle breeze, but I am willing anytime to suffer from cold, snow, and blizzards to be with you.  What has life been for me during the past nineteen months except a wanting, a longing, a yearning feeling to go back home and what is more dear to me than to go back home to my darling wife?

Another Christmas is approaching and I have no hope to come and pass it with you.  I am getting impatient.  I am fully aware of our duty.  I know that I want to contribute to our national welfare.  You know that during the darkest hours of our nation, I did not try nor thought for a moment to evade the call of duty.  When the chances of survival were few, when the war was going every day against us, I did not try nor want to evade my duty, nor evade undergoing any sacrifice.  But now it’s becoming too much.  We are living in a democracy where the people have the same duties and the same rights.  It is not right to ask so much from so few when there are so many.  We are human too.  Here I am, after 19 months, wondering what the future will bring and wondering when I’ll be able to come back to you.

I saw one of the most beautiful cities in Australia.  I was entertained and well treated.  I saw many marvelous things, but I am not happy.  I was not happy because I missed you.

I am going to try to muster enough will power to try to keep my chin up and do my duty until the fall of Hitlerism in Europe.  I hope and think this will not be many months off.  I don’t want to make any guesses about the end of the war, but I hope that the European war will end by next year.  When, I don’t know.  After that, I expect to come home.  I am going to come home to you.

How is your Mother?  You haven’t mentioned her troubles for some time.  I guess and wish that her neuralgia is only a memory, an unpleasant memory.  How is Auntie? 

I received three of your packages with all the clothing, etc.  I like the wallet you sent me.  It is just made for Australian money.  I have been wearing everything you sent me except for the pajamas.  It’s too warm to wear them.  I’ll use them next winter.  I like the life savers you sent.  I am glad you received my check and the new allotment.  You have to buy your own Christmas present.  I hope you’ll receive the sheepskin rug I sent you and the record.  Don’t forget to buy a present for your mother, aunt, and uncle from me for Christmas!

My hand is getting tired.  I am not used to writing long letters, as you know.

Darling, I love you and adore you, the best girl I’ve ever known and the best wife in the whole world.  I love you today as much and more, much, much more, than I did in Olympia 19 months ago.

I love you.

									All yours forever,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

I wish today were six years ago when, for the first time in my life, I talked about marriage to the girl of my dreams.  I remember we went to Boston.  We rode in the rain.  You drove.  I talked.  I talked about opening my office, starting a practice, and getting married.  It was six years ago today.  A Sunday afternoon.

Look now.  I am here in Australia, sweating in the tropical sun.  I must use a blotter so as not to let the sweat wet this thin writing paper.  You are so far away, maybe shivering in the cold of New England.  Thirteen days ago, it was snowing in Lowell.  How is it now?  Here the weather is becoming warmer and warmer.  No wonder.  The sun is shining overhead at noon and it’s burning.

Sunday, for the first time this year, I went to the beach for a swim.  I enjoyed it.  There were three of us and we had some fun playing in the breakers which were from two to four feet high.  I really got a kick out of it for a while.  I did not stay long because I was afraid to get sunburned.

Life is the usual.  I am doing the same thing that I have been doing for the last 21 months.  No change.  I am getting tired of it.  I am disappointed that I have not succeeded in being transferred to some other unit.  I don’t mind the fellows.  I like them.  It’s that the life is the same, monotonous and very tiresome at times.

It’s hard to say what next year has in store for me.  I’ll be around here for some time.  I’ll let you know of any danger.

The fact that I am complaining about a monotonous life will tell you that I am feeling fine.  I have not had any reason to complain about my health, which has always been very good.  I have regained the couple of pounds that I had lost in New Guinea.  I am now at my usual weight.

Some time ago, I sent you my picture.  I hope you received it.  I sent you two copies.  You can send one to my folks.  I am including another here.  It was a snapshot that has been enlarged.  I hope they will reach you before Christmas.  Have you received the sheepskin rug I sent you from the city where I passed my seven days’ leave?  I would like to know if you received the disk where a message to you was recorded.  I am keen to know what happened to it.

Yes, I do daydream.  I am sore at my daydreams!  I want them to become realities.  I’m tired of daydreaming.  I want to live my dreams.  I want to hold you in my arms, to kiss you, to love you.  I want to love you and be with you, to feel you, to breathe the same air you breathe, to sleep in the same bed, to eat at the same table, to talk to you, even to argue with you.  I want to be with you forever.  I want to tell you how much I love you.  I want to show you how much I love you.  This letter writing is not a sufficient means to convey to you how much I love you.  Oh, darling, I wish I could come home and remain there with you forever!

I love you immensely.

I am all yours, body and soul.

My darling Annette,

I have not received any news from you during the last few days.  I am sore at the mail service.  I am sure you wrote as usual.

Tomorrow, there is another date to remember.  Twenty-two months!  I recall that two years ago at this time, I was moving from North Carolina to New Jersey with one thought in my mind: to come to see you and maybe get married during my coming leave.  I did not get married, but placed the foundation.  It seems so long ago.  And see where I am today, just where I was a year ago, though I wish I were where I was two years ago.  Does it sound complicated?  I only wish to be able to come back to you, my darling.

I had a good weekend.  I went to visit the Taylors.  I had dinner and supper at their home, listened to the radio, and went for a ride in their car.  It was a short ride of a few miles because of the gasoline shortage.  We took some pictures that Mrs.Taylor promised me to send you.  They invited me to go with them to the seashore during the Christmas holidays.  I am sorry that I am not able to accept their invitation because I’ll be some other place in Australia just around here.  Do not worry.  I am not going to leave Australia for a long while.  I wish I could leave soon and for home.

I am feeling good as usual.  I have not had malaria and have put on some weight.  I do not mind the heat during the day, though some days it is excessive.  The weather is marvelous, however.

I love you, my darling.  I wish I could be with you during the Christmas holidays.  I love and adore you and am all yours forever and ever.

P.S.	I include another picture.

My darling and beloved Annette,

I have read today the letter you mailed November 22.  I am surprised.  It took only 12 days.  It’s good service.  I don’t know why you didn’t receive my letters.  I wrote you frequently during my leave and sent you a long letter upon my return.  I am anxious to know if you received what I sent you from my “vacation city.”

Today, I wrote home and sent Dad and Mother some money.  Some time ago, you asked me for a suggestion what to send Dad for Christmas.  I had the same problem.  I decided on money.  They can buy what they want.  Will you buy a gift for your mother and aunt from me?

I have sent you some pictures.  Have you received them?

Oh, darling, I have been remembering all day.  Twenty-two months ago, today.  How happy we were!  And look at today.  So far apart, with only a hope.

I keep my ear on the news.  I read the local papers methodically and thoroughly.  It will not be long!  It will take months (I don’t think a year) before Europe will be at peace again.  This makes my hopes brighter.  I think they will give us a break and send us back to the United States in the future, if not in the near future, at least not in the far future.  This will be my last Christmas passed away from you.

I can’t tell you how much I miss you.  I’ll get even some day and make up for all the time lost, n’est-ce pas?  

I love you immensely.


										I am all yours,

My own darling Annette,

I am glad to know that you received one of my letters in a very short time.  I am glad I succeeded, even in part.  I had hoped it would reach you in seven days.  Something happened that delayed it for a couple of days.

Yes, I enjoyed my vacation.  It was so different from what I have been doing during the last two years.  If only you could have been with me!  Then I would not have desired anything else.  I would have been the happiest man on earth.  I am looking forward to that day with eagerness.

It’s two weeks until Christmas.  Funny, no snow on the ground.  It’s hot.  A storm is forming in the north and is moving slowly southward.  There is rumbling in the distant, dark, gloomy clouds.  It will rain and the rain will bring coolness. It’s really hot during the day, with a burning sun hanging right on top of my head.  I move around, but I do not make any shade.  It is quite an experience to walk around during a sunny day and not be followed by your own shadow.  We have some comfort in the cool nights.  I sleep soundly and in the morning, I frequently feel in the mood to do harm to the bugler.

Have you heard the song “Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning?”  Last night, I saw the picture “This is the Army.”  I liked it.  I was not enthusiastic about it.  We who are in the Army have a natural dislike for propaganda.

I have sent you my picture.  Two copies.  I further sent you a couple of snapshots that have been enlarged.  They came out well.

I wish I could come home and be with you during the Christmas holidays, but to my regret, I am still here with no hope at the present to move toward home.  

I am all right, physically speaking.  I am deteriorating mentally.  I am getting tired of wishing and wishing to come home.  I want to come home.  Next month, it will be twenty months of overseas service.  It’s a long time in a normal span of life.  It’s longer than a thousand years when a man like me has left behind the sweetest girl on earth soon after marriage.  I should be a good patriot, keep my chin up, and not complain, but my heart is aching.  I am starving for love and home.

I do hope that the coming year will bring us victory in Europe and what’s more important to me, you and me together for keeps.

Have a million kisses.
I love you and am all yours.

Mr own darling Annette,

On this Saturday evening, I am sitting on my cot with a pad of paper on my knees to keep this v-mail writing paper from bleeding.  The evening is nice and cool, thanks to the rain that has been falling at intervals during the day and the wind that blows gently.

I am feeling well though a little tired.  I had a busy week of lectures, exercises, etc.  Don’t ask me what I learned and what I am doing because I will not tell you until I come back home.  It’s a change and I like it.  I do not enjoy the food.  It’s not as good as it used to be.

I am remembering the few days of heavenly happiness I enjoyed with you about two years ago.  A week from today, it will be Christmas, 1943!  I am disappointed.  I wanted so badly to pass it with you.  Shall we plan for next year?  I hope so.

I’m glad you received my pictures.  Some more are coming.

I love you and adore you.


										I am all yours,

My own darling Annette,

I was surprised last evening to be able to read the v-mail letter you wrote only eleven days before.  I am satisfied with the mail service.  Some days ago, I sent you a telegram of Season’s Greetings.  I hope you’ll receive it in time.  If it comes late, you’ll have a late token of me.

I have been moving around and have been busy lately.  I have not had the time to write or the disposition.  When I am tired, sleepy, and wet, I don’t feel like writing.  Today, I am well.  I had a good day of rest.  It has been warm, but a lovely breeze has mitigated the burning sun.

Do you know I went to Sydney for my leave?  I met Mr. Shaw at the local university.  He teaches Latin languages and is very good at it.  He has two beautiful children and I envy him for that.

You have been at work for more than a year.  I reckon that you need a well-deserved rest.  You told me that you felt tired and fatigued.  The winter with cold and snow is here.  Don’t you think you should rest for a while?  Or do you like to work and have this d_____ war over?  I don’t know what to tell you.  I don’t know what advice to give you.  You know better than I what you want to do.  I trust your good common sense and judgment.  But I think you should take a vacation and relax for a while.

I received the packages that Auntie and Uncle sent me.  I cherish them.  I like to pick a salty nut or a peanut and eat them.  It keeps me doing something before meals when I am hungry.

An hour ago, I felt dizzy.  I had drunk a glass of beer.  The water is bad.  It’s too salty and I don’t like it.  Today, I couldn’t drink any soft drinks so I drank beer.  I have to be careful from now on when I get dizzy.

Do you remember the date?  Three days to Christmas, 1943 and we are so far apart.  Ten thousand miles and twenty long months separate us.  Think of it!  Twenty months!

I was visiting Johnson this morning when we started to talk about going home.  He is as homesick as I am.  We both agree that it is not human to keep us away from home so long.  We agree to stay here for some months, but not as many as we have been. 

I don’t know what I would do if I could kiss you Good Morning on Christmas morning and New Year’s Eve.  We never had a Christmas together.  It’s time for us to enjoy one.  We must be together next year.

The radio was playing “That September in the Rain.”  I felt my memories stir up.  My heart melted in the remembrance of past happy days.  

I love you.  Have as many kisses as there are drops in the Pacific Ocean.


											I love you.


											Silvio

25, 1943


My darling Annette,

I am celebrating my second Christmas on Australian soil.  I said “celebrating” from force of habit, but I am not celebrating it in the real sense of the word.  To start with, I got up this morning at 3:20 A.M. I did not come back to my tent until nearly noon time.  I got up at that time instead of 2:20 A.M., the breakfast hour, on Christmas Day!  I slept an hour more thanks to the box of candy you sent me.  I mean the “rum cakes” that I received on Christmas Eve.  They were delicious.  Moreover, they came from you, my darling, my only and best girl in this whole world.

In one of your letters you ask me if I think of you as often as you think of me.  I can’t say I think of you often because it’s more than thinking.  It’s not really thinking.  It’s feeling, thinking, remembering, dreaming, and planning all mixed up together.  You are so much part of my life, thoughts, and future that I do not make a plan or wish a thing without having you playing the main part in it.  You know what I am dreaming.  It is not an exaggeration.  I only want you and a home and a fair practice to live a comfortable life with a long line of children.  You and I must have children.  I wish I could come back home and...  Today, it’s the day to think of children, to dream of children...

When I came back at noon, I was tired and sleepy.  I fell on my cot and slept until supper.  The supper was a good one with turkey and all the trimmings.  I recalled the
times you and I ate turkey.  We always ate it on New Year’s Day.

Now I am back in my tent writing to you.  I want to finish this letter before dark.  Soon it’ll be dusk.  It’s 7 P.M. now and the end of a glorious, warm afternoon even though I passed a good part of it in slumber and dreams.

I have one hope and desire today.  That is to be back with you next Christmas.  I gave two Christmases to Uncle Sam.  I hope he will give me one to pass with you.

I adore and love you, my beloved wife.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I have received your letter of December 12 a couple of days ago.  

You asked me what I think about going to work out of town.  I wrote you my opinion in a previous letter.  As I told you, I agree with Mother.  It’s fatiguing to commute during the winter and dangerous if you commute by car.  I know that you can use your common sense and I trust you.  I would like you to take a rest for a while.  You have worked a whole year.  Why not take a well-deserved rest?  This is what I would advise you as a cure for the dull headaches you are suffering from.  

I would like to know more about your headaches.  Where does it start, is it dull, sharp, or localized?  Is it worse in the morning or at night?  Are you constipated?  Do you sleep enough?  Are you eyes bothering you?  Anyhow, take a rest for a while.  Take it easy.  Do not read much.  You can help Mother doing housework!  Did you put on weight?  How much?  Am I a question box?

Dad wrote that you may go to Larchmont to pay them a visit.  I wish you would.  A change of scene would help you.  A trip to New York is always exciting.  I wish I could come and be with you.

Here I am at my last letter that I’ll write to you this waning year.  In a few hours, a new year will dawn on a world at war.  This year has come and gone and we have not seen each other.  I had hopes to come home, but I’m still here.  The year that is going has not been bad to me considering everything.  The only and main cause of my unhappiness has been the fact that I could not come back to you and be with you.  Otherwise, I consider myself lucky.  I went through a campaign in New Guinea and came back to Australia without having lost an hour from diseases or injuries.  In Australia, my life has not been so hard until lately.  I saw many movies, nearly one every night, read books, and practiced my phonetics very methodically.  I have not studied it for a month now.  I have been busy and moving around.  I have been playing pinochle with Olson and the Chaplain.  Last night I lost but I usually win. 

I am very pleased with the candy and nuts that Uncle and Auntie sent to me.  I really appreciated it and cherished them.  We have candy, but nuts are not available in our Army rations.  Moreover, lately we have been living along the seashore and the sea makes me hungry.  So, you can imagine seeing me opening the package many times during the day and picking up a few nuts or peanuts or candy and chewing them.  I send a feeling of thanks to them very often since I got their package.

Do not worry about me, darling.  I am far away from any dangerous zone and I guess I’ll be here for a long while.

We had no time off for Christmas and will not have time off for New Year’s Day either.  I hope, however, that I’ll get some time off during the middle of the next month.

We had some rain and I got wet.  My tent is well situated and does not leak.  I have slept comfortably at night while many others have been roaming around trying to find a dry spot.

Today it’s a glorious day, warm, sunny, dry, with a gentle breeze.  

Within a few hours, I’ll be in 1944.  You’ll be in 1944 fourteen hours later.  I have hopes to be with you this coming year, darling.  I am looking forward to it with eagerness.  I’ll not be disappointed this year.  By the time you read these lines, I’ll have been overseas for 22 months.  I think it’s only fair to give me and the wonderful boys that are with me a chance to enjoy the divine privilege to be at home and experience that feeling that only home and the girl of my own heart can create.  I have loved you and thought of you always during the past year and I’ll do the same this coming year.

I want this coming year, however, to think less often of you, but to love you always.  I don’t want to think of you.  I want to be with you, to see you, to love you, to talk to you, to argue with you, to have a good time with you, to feel what you feel, to live again.

I wish you, darling, a Happy New Year and many, many of them in my company.

I love you and adore you.



										I am all yours,


										Silvio
