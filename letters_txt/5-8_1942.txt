My darling Annette,

Today I came to the end of my sea voyage.  It was a long and uneventful trip.  The sea with the exception of one day was smooth and calm.  While sitting in my cabin, most of the time I did not know if the boat was moving or at a standstill.  I would have enjoyed it immensely if I felt mentally well.  I saw poetical sunsets that only poets can describe and painters paint.  I passed hours and hours on the sun deck in the tropical sun and breeze.  I crossed the equator line and international date line, but I was not happy.  All this would have given me the thrill of my life in other times.  I saw what I wanted to see for a long time, but I was not happy.  I always missed you.  I felt your absence.  I missed you.  

I have been following you during your trip back home.  I am wondering what you are doing, where you are.  Now there is a ten-hour difference between here and Lowell.  When I go to bed at 10 P.M. or 11 P.M., you are already up and I know it.  I see you in the kitchen or living room.  I know now that you are anxiously waiting for my telegram.  I will send it to you, maybe tomorrow, as soon as I land or as soon as it will be physically possible.

I wish I could come back tomorrow, my darling.  I want to see you, to love you.  I love you darling.

									
							Always and forever yours,

							Silvio

My darling Annette,

To my great surprise and supreme delight, I received two letters from you.  I did not expect mail for a month.  A few days ago, I sent you a cablegram with the following words:

Arrived Australia safely
Voyage uneventful
Feeling well
Waiting your news
I love you
					Silvio

How are you, my darling wife?  Did you receive my letter and cablegram?  I have a feeling that you received my cablegram on a Saturday evening.  Is that true?

I really had an uneventful voyage.  It would have been ideal if you were with me.  I don’t know how many times I said that to myself.  I wish you were with me.  If it were up to me, and followed my heart’s desire, I would have turned back the very moment I landed.  Not that I don’t like the country.  It’s like being in autumn again - long nights and short days.  The sun rises late and goes down earlier.  Down here, it’s all funny.  People drive on the left side of the road, dress differently, talk differently.  I have not been in town yet, but from what I hear, the people are very hospitable, like those of North Carolina.  I have the usual army life.  After I have performed my duty, I feel empty.  I miss you always.  But I hope that someday I’ll be sailing back and stay home forever.

The bedroll you bought is excellent.  It keeps me warm and comfortable.  I have been chewing the gum and eating the candy you bought me.  I eat fairly good food now.

How is everybody at home?  Did you see my folks?  Do you hear from them?  Did you send them a telegram that I arrived here safely?  I was going to call you by telephone.  So far, I could not.  I wish you could stay home Saturday nights between 8 P.M. and 11 P.M.  When I have a chance, I may call you.  Would you like to talk to me?  I would love to be able to talk with you.  I’ll do my best to succeed.  

Do not worry about me.  You know I take good care of myself.  I weigh 170 pounds - that is 12 stones and 2 pounds.  I’ve learned to handle Australian money.  It was kind of complicated at the beginning.  It’s good now.

I am waiting for more news, my darling Annette.  I hope that you enjoy a good summer.  I’ll always remember you, think of you, love you.  

I am yours always and forever.

My darling Annette,

It’s 8:30 P.M.  What are you doing?  I imagine you are sleeping in bed.  It’s 6:30 A.M. in Lowell.  The sun has already arisen and is peeping through your Venetian blinds upon you sound asleep and maybe dreaming.  I wish I could be able like the sun to come and peep through the window.  I would not stop at peeping.  I would kiss and cuddle you and love you.

I am looking forward to the day when peace will be restored and I’ll be able to fly back to you and start to live again.  I want to live in the present, not in the future, not in the past, like I am doing now.  I often close my eyes and there I go.  Space and time become non-existent.  I am back home with you.  I feel good while it lasts.  It’s better than nothing.

Are you my darling wife?  Are you taking good care of yourself?  How is your weight?  I am about the same.  I am gradually losing my tan that I acquired while crossing the tropical region.  You should have seen me.

My hair is growing back.  I lost all my frontal hair the day I crossed the equator.  King Neptune and his gang played havoc with my hair.  I did not want to go through the process of initiation, but I could not escape it, though I tried.  When I saw that all the officers were on my tail, I had to surrender.  Half a dozen of them looked for me for three hours all around the ship.  I knew the ship very well.  I got some fun out of it, but  still lost my hair.

I really had an uneventful trip.  The weather was ideal.  The sunsets were marvelous, each one better than the other.  I wish I could be able to describe to you the variations of color, shade, and shape of the clouds and sea.  I saw only a few sunrises, but saw all the sunsets.  The sunsets were my dates with you.  I waited for the first star to appear.  Sirius is the name of my star.  Can you guess what I wished when I saw it every night?  It was the same wish every night, after every sundown.  It’s now my wish:  to be back soon and be with you.

I am now in my tent.  Soon, when I am through writing, I’ll go to bed and listen to the news on Berger’s radio.

There was a small pause here.  The fire was going out.  I had to put some wood in the stove.  Tonight I am the “fire man.”  Pepe or Berger will be “fire man” some other night.
We three have a comfortable tent, kept cozy and warm by a good stove.  The bedroll you bought me is wonderful.  I still have some of the underwear you washed for me.  It’s perfumed.  I still have some of the candy you bought me.  I keep it well preserved and eat is sparingly.

Life is as usual.  I am doing my usual work and like it.  I have not seen an Australian big city yet.  All letters I write are censored.  Not yours.  My address is changed as you notice on the envelope.

It’s 9 P.M. here darling.  A good day to you.  It’s  7 A.M. today in Lowell.  My best wishes.  I love you immensely.

							
					Always and forever yours,

					Silvio

P.S.	I must write only upon one side of the page by order of the censor.  The name of an officer has to be signed on the outside of my envelope.

								Australia
								June 12, 1942

My darling Annette,

I have received on the same day the letter you sent me from Oklahoma on April 28 and one that Dad sent me from New Rochelle a couple of days after your departure for Lowell.  About two weeks ago, I received the letter you sent me from St. Louis.  From this you may get an idea how capricious and irregular the mail service is.  But it does not matter how late the letters you write come.  I always welcome them full-heartily.

How are you, my darling wife?  Soon it will be your birthday.  I wish I could be with you that day and celebrate it together.  Happy birthday, darling!  I wanted to surprise you and call you up, but the telephone service has been discontinued since April.

Finally, I had the day off.  I went to see one of the largest cities in Australia.  I was lucky to find a room in a hotel with another officer.  You cannot imagine how much I missed you.  While sitting in the lobby, I saw many couples passing by.  Was I homesick!  I had a surprise.  I saw General MacArthur.  He passed a couple of yards from me.  He looks the same as you see him in the pictures.  He is not so tall and looks and walks like a man of his age.  The man has plenty of energy.  The city was overcrowded with soldiers, but I had my good breaks.  I had an excellent meal and a good shower, saw a movie, slept in a comfortable bed and warm room, played golf and visited the zoo.  I saw all the animals of the continent.  I really enjoyed my day off.  If you were with me, it would have been complete.  It will take another month before I’ll be able to get another day of rest.  People are very kind and willing to help.  They remind me of the people of North Carolina.

People speak with an English accent.  They do not enjoy many of the luxuries that America has.  I did not see many cars and taxicab fares are very expensive.  It is not easy to buy items like in America.  Everything is rationed.  I wanted to buy you a gift for your birthday, but I could not find anything worth buying.  I am going to send you the money instead.  I have been looking forward to your birthday and saved some money that I’ll send you by cablegram.

My darling wife, I am feeling well.  I have not had a cold yet, though I am not so pleased with the weather.  I don’t think it fair to have to go through two winters one after the other.  Nights are long.  I eat my breakfast and my supper with the dining room illuminated by electric light.

How are you?  I wish I could be with you soon.  I hope this nuisance of a war will end soon.  It will never be too soon for me.  Life here is not different from any American camp.  Most of the troops are good.

Are your ears buzzing all the time?  I am always wondering what you are doing, where you are.  Now I imagine it’s beautiful in Lowell with spring all around.  How are your mother and aunt and uncle?  Did you hear from my folks?  Dad wrote me.  Poor man, he tries to encourage me.  This war is worse on you than it is on us!  So far, everything has been running smoothly.  I had a wonderful trip.  If I could be able to have you with me, I would not mind this life.  I would like it.  Pepe and Berger are still my tent companions.  We are getting along fine.  Tornambee is nearby, two miles from here.  He is all right.  How did you get along with Rose?  You did not mention her in your letters.

Now it’s time to leave.  I must report to duty.  I’ll be thinking of you while marching through the Australian hills and swamps.

Darling, I love you.  Have many, many, many kisses.  I love you.

					All yours and forever your husband,
					Silvio

My darling wife,

This letter has been written at different intervals - last night, this morning, noon, and now in the evening.  Do you know that I just received your letters that you sent me from the Grand Canyon and California?  It’s funny that I received your letter from St. Louis more than two weeks ago.

I wish I were with you.  I wished day after day while I was on the boat that you were with me.  I had marvelous days of sunlight.

You have all my kisses, millions and millions.  I am always your faithful husband.

					Silvio

My darling wife,

I was reading this evening the letter you wrote on the day I moved down the stream and out of sight into the vast ocean.  I had the same feelings.  I looked all day while on deck toward the shore.  I was going to write you my impressions daily, but I was told by the authorities that if I intend to write a diary or daily letter, that I should deposit it for the duration of the war at Army headquarters.  I felt as bad as you did.  I woke up in the morning and  found myself in the middle of the stream.  I felt a pang of pain and desolation.  All my hopes to see you again vanished like mist before the sun.  All my doubts and fears became actual reality.  I did not sleep any more that day.

Paul and I kept talking about you all the way down here.  Our greetings were always “I wonder where the girls are?”  I did not think you would cross the country so quickly.  I was afraid something would happen to you.  I am glad you are home.

What do you do?  Did you receive my monthly allotment?  Will you please let me know about it?

Today is St. Anthony of Padua’s feast day.  I remember it.  I used to celebrate it.  Today, instead, I worked all day, walked and marched in the rain.  Thanks to my good raincoat, I did not get wet.

Tonight it’s Saturday night.  You’ll be home tonight with Uncle.  I wish I were there.  Oh, how I would kiss and love you!  It will come one day.  I’m looking forward to it.  I love you , my darling wife.

									

									I love you.

My darling Annette.

I am receiving every couple of days one of the letters you sent me during your quick trip home.  Today I received a letter you wrote in New Mexico and one you wrote in Tulsa, Oklahoma.   It took them a long time to come here.  They are nearly two months old, but are as welcome as if they were written yesterday.  I have not heard any news from you since St. Louis, Missouri.  I would like to know how you reached home, how you have been.  I noticed a shadow of doubt in your letters.  You were experiencing the same feelings I was.  Today the future is brighter.  There is more hope.  I am in a good place, far away from any danger.  So far, so good.

I do my daily amount of walking.  I am becoming tough and getting hard, muscular legs.  We all are.  As the time passes, there is a gradual increase of confidence.  The men, as a whole, are more sure of themselves and do not feel second to any in the world.

What are you doing now?  Here it’s 9 P.M.  At home, it’s 7 A.M. today.   Years past, at this time I was with you.  Do you remember?  I was thinking about it today while climbing an Australian hill.  Then you were in bed because it was during your night hours and during my hours the sun was high in the sky.  Here we are in full winter.  Nights are long, days short, but the trees are still bearing leaves and the hills and valleys are still green.  The mornings are cold and damp.  So far, I had only one day of frost.

How are you, my darling wife?  Are you getting your monthly check?  How much did you pay for the pictures we took in Olympia, Washington?  The bank sent me the check you signed on April 6 for $24.  Wasn’t it $14?  I’ll include the check.  It’s all right.  I remember now that you got $10. in cash. 

I am wondering when you’ll receive this letter.  Who knows how long it will take to reach you?  I am hearing now the news from London, England through Berger’s radio.  My darling, do not worry about me.  I’ll do my utmost to get back home.  That’s all I am thinking about and yearning for.  I’m dreaming about the day I’ll be kissing you again.  I hope it will be soon. maybe sooner than I hope.  It would not disturb me.

I love you, my darling wife.  I am wishing for your news, written by your own hand.

I love you sincerely.

									Yours,
									Silvio

My darling Annette,

Do not be surprised or hurt because I send you a typewritten letter instead of handwritten one as it is proper to do.  I have been playing with the typewriter machine for the last few days and I want to show you that I am able to type.  Please do not ask how long it will take.  I will let you know before I am through.  I will tell you that it does take some time to find where all the letters are placed.

These last few days have been lucky for me.  I have received three letters from you, darling, and one from Dad.  They are all a month old or longer, but they sound like music to me.  It really felt as if I were with you.

I am glad that you received my cablegram sooner than I expected.  I felt that you were waiting.  I really try my best to send it as soon as possible.

How are you, my darling wife?  I guess you are going to swim now.  I, instead, am shivering in the cold.  No fooling!  This morning, my tent was all covered with frost.  It was cold.  I was lucky that Berger and Pepe got up before I did.  They lighted the stove at 5 A.M.  We get up early every morning.  The sun gets up one hour or two after we do.  I am used to it now, but not to the cold.  Thanks to the bedroll you bought for me I am nice and warm all night and do not worry about when I have to sleep out in the fields at night.  Now, it is the middle of winter here and the coldest days of the year are around the corner.  I wish I were home with you and able to go swimming with you and get a good sunburn at Nahant Beach.  Do you remember?  It was about four years ago.

Here life is running as usual.  I am taking care of the sick as usual.  I wish they would pay me two dollars for each visit.  Some days I would be able to make more than a hundred dollars.

I agree with you.  I am going to try to send you a cablegram at least once every month.  Now I am waiting for your birthday.  I am sorry I cannot buy you a gift or a present.  To compensate for that, I will send you the money.  You can buy with it what you like or think you need much better than I can.  I signed the blank you sent me.  I will make a point to include it in the letter.

I was very pleased with your intention to become an excellent cook.  I know you can cook.  Do you remember the meal you cooked for me in Shelton?  It was grand, my darling.

If you can save some money, by all means do.  However, I do not want you to deprive yourself of what you need and do not try to starve yourself to death to look slim.  I love you as you are.  Your should get some sun now.  It will help you not to catch cold in the winter time.

Tell Oliva to be careful about the boyfriends she is going out with.  They like to have a good time with all the girls, but they marry girls of their own religion and girls with money.  I saw this happen in many cases already.  I wish her good luck however with all my heart.  

I admire and am proud of you.  I think that it’s a very good idea to teach English.  Have I a wonderful wife?  Did I tell you that many times before?  I agree with you.  It is better to take a position in Lowell.  You have all the facilities of your home and you already have good experience in that field.  This will make your work much easier and moreover it is work that you like.

It took me one hour and a half!  Not so bad.  My fingers are tired now.  

Remember me to your mother, aunt, and uncle.  I wish you a happy summer, my darling wife.  I love you very, very much.  And I do remember you!  Always!  Every day, every hour of the day, in the dark and the sunlight, awake and in my dreams.  I love you.
Have all my kisses,  all of them, and many, many more!

								All yours,
								Silvio

P.S.  You will excuse all my corrections, won’t you?  I think I am coming along fairly well.

								Love you,
								Silvio

									July 10, 1942

My darling Annette,

Within a few days I have received three of the letters that you wrote me between May 21 and June 9.  The funny part of it is that I received first the letter of June 9 and then the other.  As you know, I do not mind if the mail is irregular.  Your letters are always welcomed and received with a feeling of elation.  It is a grand day for me when I receive your letters.  One of these arrived on July the seventh.  It made the day perfect.  Do you remember what happened five months ago in the quiet town of Carlisle?  I sent you my heartfelt birthday greetings.  I do not know how you liked it, but I felt proud when I wrote down “Happy Birthday, my darling wife.”   That is what I would have told you that morning if I were home with you, my darling Annette.  I sent you some money with it ($161.)  It was what I was able to save during the last three months.  You may use all of it or some of it.  It is up to you.  You may save some for a rainy day.  We will need plenty of money when I come back some day in the year 1943.  I have a feeling that most of the fighting will be over by next year.  We will continue our honeymoon where we left it off.  We will crowd a full house with our children.  It is better not to talk about the number now.  Or do you think that a couple of dozen will be enough?

Do not worry about the Aborigines or Aboes as they call them here.  They live far away from here, thousands of miles away.  Moreover, they are not cannibals.  Some are serving their country.  Most are law-abiding citizens.  I am sorry that I will not be able to bring home a nugget of gold.  The gold mines are too far away and the days of the gold rush are bygone even for Australia.  About a month ago I visited one of the largest cities of this continent.  I wanted to buy a golden gift for you.  The jewelers told me that they have stopped manufacturing golden jewelry since the war started.  

Yes, Lt. Pepe is our censor.  He censors all the mail that leaves the camp.  I pity the poor fellow.  He has to read piles and piles of mail every week.   He does not censor your mail.  Nobody does.  I received all your mail as you wrote it.

I do not know what to tell you about the disease that is ailing your dear friend, Sister.  I wish her good luck.  Give her my best regards and thanks.

I donned my union suit again.  I am glad that I bought them and brought them with me. 
They keep me warm and comfortable.  Please do not laugh about them.  I like them.

I wrote to my folks the same time I wrote to you.  I cannot understand why they did not receive my letters.  Did you cash the $35. check you mention in one of your letters?  

Two weeks ago I went to the city for the weekend.  Do not get sore that I did not send you any postcards.  I cannot do it.  It is against regulations.  I wrote a few lines that I will copy down.

	Here I am waiting for dinner and a train to go back to the camp.  I came in last 
	night.  I came into town for a good meal and a good night’s sleep in a soft bed 	and to take a shower.  I wanted to be alone with myself.  It was like being with 	you.  You were present with me at the movies, while I visited the city by trolley
	car (taxis are too expensive - three or four times as expensive as they were in 
	America when I left) and while I visited the zoo.  In this city, the zoo is the only
	entertainment that the people have.  No movies, no theatres, no restaurants are 
	open.  I got my meals from the hotel dining room.  I was alone all day, but I liked
	it.  Nobody bothered my train of thought.  Oh, how I missed you!  I tell you we 
	were in town together.  I wish you were here at breakfast this morning.  You 
	would have loved it.  The hotel’s restaurants are good.  The service is exactly
	what you like.  

I am as usual.  I feel very well, but I miss you.  I wish I were with you back home.  The weather is cool, but not cold.  I hope this rain will stop some day.  

My darling wife, have all my love and many, many kisses.  I love you very, very much.

								Yours,
									
								Silvio

									July 16, 1942

My darling wife,

Another day and no mail.  The mail clerk returned from the Regimental Headquarters carrying a few letters in his hands, but none for me.   I was hopeful for a few seconds when I saw him appear at the door of the dispensary.  It is all over now.  No mail for me. Do you know that I was spoiled last week when I received a letter every other day for a few days?

How are you, my darling?  Are you suffering from the excessive heat?  I imagine that you are moving from one room of the house to another in search of a cool corner to rest and be comfortable while I am wearing everything I have in order to keep myself warm.  I move from one stove to another and stay longer near the stove that is the warmest.  I shiver in the cold mornings and evenings.  At noon when the sky is clear, the sun is warm.  Some days it is so warm that it feels like springtime in Lowell.  Do you remember the beautiful spring of 1936?

Yesterday I went to the city.  Do you remember that I wrote you that one of the largest cities in Australia is near our camp?  I went to the city to do my shopping.  The Army gives us a day a month to do our shopping.  I left the camp in the early afternoon in the company of Berger and Pepe.  We arrived in town in time to rent a room and have a meal and a good shower bath.  I passed the rest of the evening at the movies.  I saw “Ladies in Retirement.”  I was surprised.  I was looking forward to seeing a comedy, having a laugh, and forgetting the miseries of the day.  Instead I saw a tragedy.  I do not intend to tell you what the picture was about because I think you already saw it.  It was shown in the United States a long time ago.  Here it is new.  This morning I went shopping first and then I played golf with a friend.  I bought a couple of things:  a steel mirror that I can use to shave when I go out into the field and can place anywhere in my bag without being afraid to break it and a mosquito net that I will find very useful in the summer when millions of mosquitoes will hang around our camp.

I was surprised to meet two officers that I knew in Boston.  We had a chat about New England.  They were as anxious to come back as I am.  It made me feel very good for a while at least.

I like these shopping days.  It is a day off.  It is a day of relaxation.  It really feels good to go to bed at night and remain in bed as long as I please in the morning.  I feel rested and ready and willing to stand this life for another month now.

The novelty of the country is wearing down.  I wish I were back home with you.  Soon it will be three months since we kissed goodbye.  I wish this war would stop soon.  I want to come back to you.  I miss you all the time.  I looked and looked through the streets that were crowded with people.  I knew I was not going to meet you, but still I was looking forward to seeing you.  I love you so much, darling.  I would like to kiss you again and again forever.  
						I am all yours forever,

						Silvio

P.S.	How do you like my typing?  As you see, I still make mistakes.  I have not had much time to practice lately.  I am still enjoying it, however.  I love you very, very much.  

I kiss you, darling.

									Australia
									July 17, 1942

My darling Annette,

I have received your wonderful letters of June 10th and 14th.  I received them a few minutes ago.  I was attending a meeting when the Sergeant who takes care of the mail brought me the good tidings that he had left two letters in my tent.  I immediately asked to be excused and ran to my darling wife’s letters.  I read them in a very short time.  I devoured them.  I was very happy for a while.  I was in seventh heaven.  I was home again.  I was with you.  It does make me so happy that my heart pumps faster.  I am still thrilled.  I thank you for the rose you sent me.  It is still perfumed.  I will send you some of the Australian flowers when the spring returns.  It will not be very long now.  Maybe the next letter I write you I will be in the spring.  I do hope that the cold weather will come to an end soon.  I do not like it.

Yes, darling Annette, I do think of you and I do love you.  I am glad you like the change made by the censor.  Yes, I do adore you with all my heart and all my being.  I would give a few pounds of my flesh to be with you.  Some day I will be with you!  We will make up for all the time they stole from us.  Nobody will separate us any more for all the wealth of the world.

We do not use dollars here.  We use Australian money.  That is:  one pound is equivalent to $3,228.  The pound is equivalent to 20 shillings.  The shilling is equivalent to 12 pence.  Some food and clothing are cheaper than at home, some others are more expensive.   To us Flag Day was another day.  I was on duty all day.  The work I am doing is the same one I was performing in Fort Lewis or in Shelton.  We take care of the usual winter diseases.  Here, darling, it is like being in Fort Dix or Fort Lewis.  I cannot tell you the name of the city I visited.  It would be useless because the censor without any doubt would cut it out.

You should see me read your letters.  You would know what I feel and think when I am with you.  You would feel how happy I am.  Every word, every thought is like music to my ears.  I love to read your letters.  I always did, even in the troublesome times.

I am feeling very well.  I am well trained in long marches and can sleep on the ground without complaining about it.  Do you know what I do with my spare time?  I type at an average of an hour every day.  I like it.  It is fun for me.  The officers cannot understand it, but I like it and as the Romans used to say, “ de gustibus non est disputandum.”  I feel I am mastering a new technique, one I did not know before.  That feeling alone gives me pleasure.  I feel I am growing, I am expanding.  A few days ago I bought an English grammar.  I am going to read it very carefully in my spare time.  It is a review for me.  I noticed that I pick up many slang expressions.  I want to purify my English.  I do not know how long my ambition will last.  I hope it will last a long time.  It keeps my mind busy. 

Yes, darling, you can send me packages and whatever you want.  You take a risk, however.  If I were you, I would not send anything that is very expensive.  Yes, darling, I did try to call you, but it was not possible.  The only way I can call you is by using a third person.  This person would talk to you and would tell me what you told him.  It is better to send a telegram once in a while.  It is impossible to talk directly.

Here the people use the stone as a unit of weight.  A stone is equivalent to 14 pounds.  Yes, all cars ride on the left side of the road.  My wristwatch is working perfectly.  It was a very good buy.

I talk about my wife too.  The other day the chaplain asked me if I smoke.  I said no.  Do you drink?  No.  Do you go after women?  No, I said.  I have the best girl in the world as my wife.  There is no other woman in the whole world who can take her place.  The chaplain was pleased.  He is a Protestant but still, morally, he is good. 

Darling, have all my kisses.  Many and many kisses.  I love you and more, I adore you with all my heart. 


							I am all yours forever,

							Silvio

My darling Annette,

This noon, I received your letter of June the 14th.  About two weeks ago, I received the one you wrote me the following day.  I shall not complain about the mail service.  I should be thankful that I am able to receive it.  

How are you, darling?  Is it still too warm for you?  Do you miss me?  I wish this war would end soon and I would be able to come back home.  I miss you all the time.  Last night, I was admiring the moon.  I was sitting near an open fire.  The sky was clear of any clouds.  The night was quiet.  I was dreaming that if you were here, it would be ideal.  But, someday we will be together and we will enjoy ourselves for the time that we lost.  Don’t you think so?  Oh darling, how beautiful it is here.  I never saw such a clear day.  I told you that soon it will be spring.  It is spring now for 9 or 10 hours every day.  It is warm, it is comfortable.  It is like the month of September in Lowell.  The mornings and evenings are still cold.  I am still wearing my union suit.  I washed it a couple of times already.

Recently I have seen many things.  This morning, for instance, an hour before I received your letter, I saw two kangaroos jumping away from me.  I took a walk through the bushy and wooded hills with my men.  It was about 10:30 A.M. when I called the attention of the men to two jumping, gray, funny animals.  It did not take them more than a few seconds to jump up the hill and disappear from our view.  Can they jump!  I saw them jumping 10 or 12 yards at a time.

When recently I saw orange orchards with ripe oranges hanging down from their tender branches, it reminded me of the time we saw and visited southern California.  I felt a pain in my heart.  The memory was so vivid in my mind.  I have seen a great deal of things lately.  I saw banana orchards spread through the hills, sugar cane fields, and Aborigines.  These look like the American Negroes.  Their jaws are larger and more protruding.  They dress and talk like the Australians.

I have seen all the cities you mention in your letter.  I cannot tell you where I am now.  It would not be fair to let the Japanese know where we are.  I know that you would not tell it to anybody, but the censor does not believe that.  The life here is as usual.  Nothing is new, but what I told you. I am reading when I have time.

I am missing the daily papers.  I have not seen one for a while.  Lt. Berger changed his mind and brought the radio with him.  I am not in his tent anymore.  I share my tent now with Captain Sleeter.  He is a nice fellow.  I get along with him very well.  It is much better than with Berger.  I am very glad that I do not have him around me any more.  Yesterday, I saw Tornambee.  We are going to play golf this weekend.  There is a golf course not far from here.  Father Freeman will come with us.  He is a chaplain in my unit.  I played golf with him a week ago.  He is a better player than I am.  I only beat him on a couple of holes.  He beat me on the rest.  It is a good way to pass the time and forget.

Darling, I wish you an enjoyable fall.  That will be the season of the year by the time you receive this letter. 

I love you very much.  Have many, many kisses.

						

							I am all yours,

							Silvio

									August 7, 1942

My darling Annette,

Half a year ago today, we got married in Carlisle.  You asked me if I were sorry I married you.  Why should I be?  Do you remember that about five years ago we met at the Outpatient Department of St. Joseph’s Hospital?  How could I feel sorry when I yearned and hoped for year after year to become your husband?  Do you remember what I told you one day at lunch in a downtown restaurant in Carlisle and another time in Los Angeles?  Didn’t I tell you that I am married to the best girl in the world?  I know I have the best wife in the world.  I could not have married anybody else.  I was never as happy as I was after our marriage.

Before and as I bid you goodbye on April 21, I was merry and jovial.  What else could I do?  I could not bear to see you crying.  Moreover, I had suffered so much when and after I knew I was going to leave that I became callous to the pangs of pain in my heart.  I had some hope, but a very faint hope.  It was more wishful thinking than a hope.  I was resigned and ready to take it on the chin like a man.  Then I was sure I was going to leave.  Only a miracle could have kept me back.  I was resigned to my fate and willing to make the best of it.  The idea of a voyage across the Pacific Ocean had some appeal for me, though I would have cordially refused if it was possible.  But I surmise that my subconscious mind was telling me that someday I would be back to start where I left off.  I knew that you would be waiting for me.  Won’t you, my darling?

Meanwhile, I carry one.  Life is dragging on.  The weather is springlike.  The days are usually cloudless.  It rains rarely and then only for a few minutes.  As usual, the mornings and evenings are cool, but not as cold as they used to be.  The noon weather is warm.  Soon I will be swimming in the ocean.

Yesterday, I received my check.  I needed the money.  I had only two shillings in my possession.  A weekend in the city, many meals eaten with the chaplain at various restaurants, and golf during my trip reduced me to a nearly penniless state.  I played golf a few times.  Last Tuesday, I played with Paul and Father Freeman.  We had a grand time.  At the end of the game, an Australian gentleman invited us to have tea and sandwiches and cookies.

I like the picture you sent me.  I like the trick.  What a couple of beautiful legs you have!  Do you know, darling, that I would like and cherish to have a picture of you alone?   I would like to have a profile picture as a birthday present.  Try to have one taken in nearly the same pose as the one you took in Tacoma.

Did you receive a telegram and $161. as a birthday present?  I am waiting for your telegram.  Did you reach the thousand?  The chocolate came as you mailed it.  Was it good!  I ate it all already.  Yes, I feel blue and too often.  I do not see any people.  I go for weeks without seeing a civilian.  

Thank you for your kisses.  Do you know how many I got?  150!  I send you tenfold and a hundredfold that number.  

Did you stop in Carlisle on your way back home?  I suppose you did.  How are your folks?  Any news in Lowell?  Did you see my folks?  Did you go swimming?

My darling Annette, I love you.  I wish I could come back home.  I would be willing to leave right this moment with this v-letter.  

Darling, have all my love.  I adore you, darling.

						

								I am all yours,


								Silvio

My darling wife,

I have received your first v-mail letter.  I was in a state of exhilaration when I received it and when I started to read it.  But as I reached the end of the third paragraph, I got a great disappointment.  I was surprised to be at the end of the letter.  I was anxious to know how you are, how much you love me, how you had passed your birthday, how you liked the greetings I sent you for your birthday, and if you had received the money I had sent with which to buy a present for you from me. 

If you are ready and willing to cross the ocean to come to see me, you can easily imagine how much I would like to be able to come back to you, my darling wife.  I do love you.  I cannot tell you how much I miss you.  There is nobody in the world that can take your place in my heart.  Do you know, darling, that I miss your kisses and your love?  You did not send me any this time.  I hope I will receive them in the second part of the letter that will come later. 

How are you, my darling Annette?  I am as usual.  I am feeling very well.   The weather, darling, is ideal.  Here I am sitting on my footlocker.  The typewriter is on a board that lies upon my cot.  The tent keeps the rays of the sun from hitting my face.  It is warm.  A gentle breeze is blowing from the east.  It does give me comfort.  I never saw such wonderful weather.  It is really wonderful.  The sky is cloudless.  The horizon is always clear and neat.  I wish you could come down here.  I know that you would love it.  We could have such a grand time, just like we used to have,

Yes, darling, I feel blue often and I have many reasons to feel in such a way.  Not only have I been sent away from my darling wife, but I do not see any chance to improve my position.  

I have a nice group of men to work with.  The officers are the best I ever had.  They are intelligent and competent.  It is a real pleasure to be with them.  There is no comparison between these men and those I had last year.  You remember what type they were.

I have been dedicating my free time to the study of phonetics.  I take it very seriously.  I have a teacher who gives me a lesson every day.  I practice and practice every time I have a chance.  I read books and study the grammar.  I feel that I am improving little by little.  But even if I do not improve, I keep myself busy and that saves me from the blues.  

Since the middle of July, I am the censor of the detachment.  I read all the letters that the men write to their families and friends.  I have done some research that may interest you.  I took down all the words that they use to write and I found that they use only a thousand words.  So far, I have read a couple of hundred letters.  I found that the number of words ranges in proportion with their education.  Some of them do not use more than two hundred words to write dozens and dozens of letters.  I do not know how they can say the same things again and again.  I do not mind reading again and again how much they love their dear ones.  That is natural.  I do the same thing.  I do not like to read the same things, for instance, about the Australian people.  Some are masters at coloring the news and can they exaggerate!  If they see one kangaroo today, they are able to write home that they see them every day.

I few days ago, I had my shopping day.  I bought a bathing suit for 25 shillings and 5 coupons, had a haircut, a good, hot shower, a delicious meal, and a game of golf with two officers, and saw an old movie that I did not see in the States when it was shown some time last year.

How is your Mother?  I think she is suffering from neuralgia.  It will take some time before she will be normal.  I am sorry, darling, that I cannot send you a prescription.  I do not possess any blanks.  Will you write Dad to send you a few prescription blanks?  Then you can send them to me.  I will fill them for you.

A few days ago I sent a cablegram to my mother for her sixtieth birthday.  I am anxious to know if she has received it.  How is Auntie?  Do you still beat her at Chinese checkers?

I guess by the time you receive this letter the pears of your orchard will be ripened and possibly already eaten. 

My darling Annette, have millions and millions of kisses and all my love.


					

							I am all yours,


							Silvio

My darling wife,

What a week!  Can you imagine?  Within a few days, I received all the letters you wrote me between July 7th and August 5th, 1942.  It has been wonderful reading.  It made me very happy.  I have waited for weeks for a few days like the last ones.  

I am glad to hear that you have received my cablegram.  I am sorry that it did not reach you in the time that it was intended to.  I was told that it would reach you within 48 hours of the time I sent it.  From your letters I surmise that it took two weeks.  I am really sorry to have made you unhappy on your birthday.  I kept saving for three months.  I wanted to give you palpable evidence of my love for you.  I thought of you all day.  I hoped that you would receive my telegram in time.  I do not know why, but during the last three years, I never had any luck in reaching you on your birthday. 

It is no use.  I cannot tell you where I am.  I see many lizards nearly every day, but I am never in the mood to talk to them.  I always have a great number of men to talk to.  These lizards, by the way, are funny-looking reptiles.  They are four or five times the size of ours and have a fringe around their necks that looks like a collar.  I do not know why I should think of the collars that the noblemen of Spain wore in the sixteenth century.  

How are you, my darling wife?  What’s new in Lowell?  By the time you receive this letter, I hope it is cool and comfortable in your house.  Did you get the position you mentioned in your last letter?  I do not mind if you work and like the work.  But please, darling, do not bother with it if you do not like it.

I am carrying along as usual.  I feel very well.  I did not put on any weight, but my muscles are heavier.  I like it here.  I like it better than where I was before.  The weather is ideal.  I know you would love it.  It is like the fall in New England.  Do you remember, darling, the day we went to visit Dr. Popoli in Leominster (is the name of the town spelled correctly)?  We had weeks and weeks of days like that.  It has been wonderful.  Nobody would be happier than I if it were possible to have you come down to see me and stay forever with me.  I will be back someday.  Nobody will separate us again.  Never!

Yesterday, I played a game of golf.  I was alone.  I could not get in touch with Paul and the chaplain was busy with his religious functions all day.

I have received mail from Dad and from my sister.  I was surprised to read a letter from Lena.  I know very well that she does not like to write to anybody.  Does she write to you?

Here, there is a pause of about two hours.  I had to leave you, darling, to go to teach first aid to the men.  I took a short walk, stopped, talked for an hour, then came back to you.  

I think it is better to save and keep the money.  I am sure we will need it when I come back.  We are rich.  I know I have the best wife in the whole world.

Thank you for the beautiful picture you sent.  I like it.  I know I have a beautiful wife.  I proudly showed it to my fellow officers.  I would like to have an enlargement of it.  A color picture of it would be wonderful. 

Do you know that you make me sore when you write than my wife’s letters are not well written and interesting?  I love every line you write, darling.  I do read your letters again and again.  There is no writer, nor ever was, who can write better than you do.  No book of poetry or philosophy can give me the pleasure and happiness that your letters give me.

My beloved Annette, have millions and millions of kisses.  I love you very, very much.


							

							I am all yours,


							Silvio

									August 31, 1942


My darling Annette,

I have not heard from you for a few days.  I am not worried nor complaining.  I have received enough mail and should be satisfied.  I say I should be satisfied...

Darling, today, it is a special day.  It is a day to remember, a date that I shall never forget as long as I live.  August 31st is a day of sweet, lovely memories.  At this time, five years ago, I was shaving, taking a bath, and getting ready to meet the girl of my dreams.  I had a date with her at 6 o’clock at the end of the cement bridge.  I remember that I waited for five minutes. You came and missed me.  You passed, but you came back.  We thought we were going to go swimming.  You had a towel and a bathing suit in the back of the car.  I had my own bathing suit.  But we did not.  We drove to Boston, strolled along the Common, saw “The Life of Zola,” and rushed back home.  What a wonderful time!  Today, instead, we are far, far apart.

Half an hour ago, I came back to my tent. It is now 4 P.M. I am a little tired.  I was warm.  I am comfortable now.  I have removed my shirt, shoes, socks, and pants.  A gentle breeze is blowing.  It is grand here.  I wish you could be here.  We could have a grand time.

Last night, I came back from a weekend passed at a nearby town the size of Port Chester.  Saturday afternoon, Paul and I went to the horse races.  I played and lost a few pennies.  I had a good time.  It was the first time I saw a horse race.  I had dinner at a hotel and saw a picture that I had already seen in the States and forgotten (“Life Begins for Andy Hardy”).  I slept in a private house.  The chaplain gave me the name of a family.  The lady gave me the key of the house and the best room she had.  She was very kind to me and she invited me again.  I slept comfortably in the sheets, but not as comfortably as I thought I would.  I have not slept in a bed for such a long time that I nearly felt uneasy.  I got up at 6:30 A.M. The lady woke me up and brought me tea in bed.  She reminded me of your mother.  Her husband is a police sergeant of this state.  She has three grown boys, one of whom will be a priest in a few years.

I got up early because I wanted to commemorate the fifth anniversary of our trip to Boston in a way that I thought would please you more than anything else.  I went to the seven o’clock mass at the Cathedral.  I prayed in my own way that soon I would be able to come back home to you.  Then, I had breakfast -  a good one.  Then, two guesses.  You are right.  Yes, I went to play golf.  Paul and I played for five hours.  We were so tired that we had to take a couple of hours rest.  I enjoyed it.

Last night, I saw “The Smart Girls” and liked it.  

There is no use, darling, to talk about promotions.  I saw my superior officers and asked about it.  The promotions here are not as easy as they are in the States.  The only chance for promotion will come when somebody who has a higher rank than I have will be promoted to a higher rank or will die.  My superior officers agree with me that I should be promoted.  But they cannot go against the regulations dictated from the Capital.  Do not get upset about it, darling.  I will be promoted someday.  I am really more interested in coming home than in all the promotions in the world.  Considering everything, this job is one of the easiest in the Army.  Why should I worry?  I have no responsibilities, no headaches, and have time to study my English lessons.  I do not want my wife to be ashamed of my English. 

I am feeling fine.  I am getting a new tan.  By the time the summer is here, I will have a very good tan.  There is nothing new around here.  There is nothing to write about.  We have some men who write home every day.  I read those letters.  They do nothing else but repeat the same thing again and again all the time.  There is a man who writes to his wife every day.  By now, I know by heart what he writes.  I pity the poor lady who has to read the same stuff all the time.  I know that the mail reaches the States two or three times a month.  I try my best to have a letter of mine for you in every boat that leaves for home.

Darling, the bugler is blowing that supper is ready.  I have to leave you now.  I will not be able to write to you after supper because it will be too dark.  I had a good supper: roast beef, gravy, sweet potatoes, rice pudding, bread and butter, and tea.  It is becoming darker and darker.  I can hardly see what I type.  I do not think I would be able to type if I did not know the keyboard by heart.

Annette, darling, I love you.

I came to the end of the page before I knew it.  I love you very, very much.  Always thinking of you.


								I am always yours,


								Silvio


P.S.	Darling, will you send me a few blanks of v-mail?  I cannot obtain more than one every two or three weeks.  Annette, I love you darling.  Have billions and billions of kisses.
