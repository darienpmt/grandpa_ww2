My darling Annette,

Last night, I received the v-mail letter you wrote on April 11.  I am very pleased with the mail service.  It has worked very well lately.  The letters reach me at intervals according to the time you write them.  Months ago, I used to receive them in a bunch of five or six at a time.

It’s Sunday afternoon.  I have been reading most of the day.  Everything is quiet.  It’s a cloudy day with no wind, not warm.  It is comfortable to sit down and read and dream.

I am feeling very well and during the last few nights I have been very successful at trapping rats.  I have caught one or two every night.  They are not mice.  They are BIG rats.  I have been trying to catch them for more than two months.  Now, I can say that I have outsmarted them.  My trap is fool proof.  The rats are like kids.  They like candy.  I allure and catch them with a little bit of candy.  They really fall for it.  They like the life savers you sent me.  I eat or suck on 3/4 of a life saver - the remaining 1/4 is for the rats.  I do not know if you will understand, but I do consider it a victory of man over the rat kingdom.  

When my trap was unsuccessful and every morning to my dismay I found the bait gone and no rat, the Chaplain and Olson called it my trap.  The used to kid me and tell me that my trap was no good.  However, they never tried to make one.  Now, it is quite different.  The Chaplain is boasting now about how effective our trap is in catching rats.  It’s no longer my trap now, it’s our trap.  It’s fun!

Life is going on as usual.  I am studying and practicing phonetics a few hours every day.  Every night, I listen to the news broadcast from San Francisco.  When the news is broadcast, you are in bed because in Lowell it’s only five o’clock in the morning.

How is everybody at home?  I heard from my folks recently.  I heard from Paul.  He is all right.  Pepe is a few miles from me.  He is fine.  He was kind of shaky when he came here, but now he is all right.  Berger, still a lieutenant, is sick.  

Let me know if you have any news about the men who served more than one year overseas.  I am anxious to come back home to you.

I love you with all my heart and body.

										I am yours,

My darling Annette,

I have received your v-mail of April 21.  How is your sore throat?  I wish I were with you.  I would have taken good care of you and cured you in a very short time.  By now, I hope you are well and full of pep.  

Some time ago, I told you that I was going to send you some money.  So far, I have not received it.  I’ll be paid some time in the future, maybe next month or the following one.

I wanted to send you some money for your birthday.  I am going to send you the little money I saved from my pay check of January first.  I do not know what to do with the money anyhow.  Since I have been in New Guinea, I only spent a few pounds.  I paid the man who takes care of my laundry, the man who serves me at the table, and the barber.  We do not have to pay for movies or for refreshments.  The latter do not exist, the former are free.

Life is going on as usual.  I am enjoying a wonderful summer day.  The sky is cloudless, a gentle breeze is blowing, the sun in strong, but not excessively warm.  

Last night, I did not sleep so well.  I got up four times, every time to liquidate a rat caught in my trap.  Think of it!  I caught four rats in one night!  What a victory!  Since I wrote you last, my war with the rats was complicated by the appearance of an army of ants, who systematically devoured the bait before the rats had a chance to taste it.  It took me some experimenting.  I burned them and I drowned them to no avail.  The more I burned, the more I drowned, the more they came in larger and larger numbers.  Yesterday, I got an idea.  From the kitchen, I picked four empty cans with a wide bottom and small height and four cans with a small bottom and higher than the large ones.  I put water in the large-bottomed ones and placed the tall ones in the large ones.  Does it sound too complicated?  I’ll sketch how they look. 
If you look from top to bottom, they appear in this form. 

If seen from the side, they look this way.

Here lies the trap.

Does this bother you?  Do you see I am waging a personal war against the rats because they ate my candy, burrowed holes in my socks, and what was a real insult to me more than once used the box on which is standing the picture of my wife as a toilet?
And was is worse, they did not pull the chain to wash the toilet.

My work is the same.  I am kept busy between patients and rats.  As you see, darling, it has to be quite calm here for me to dedicate so much of my time to trapping rats.  I still keep on doing my phonetics exercises.

I am feeling fine.  I only wish that I could come back home soon.  It is not fair.  We have been married 15 months and we only had 10 stingy weeks together.  If they had any heart, they should consider our condition and give us a break.  I have a feeling, however, or is it wishful thinking, that sometime in the future, who knows when, I‘ll come home to kiss you and love you and be with you forever.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio


My love and best wishes for your birthday!  I adore you.

My darling Annette,

It was a year ago yesterday that I landed in an Australian port.  I was glad to put my feet on solid ground, sad to be so far away from you.  A whole year has passed.  How long more before I’ll sail for home?  I wish the day would come soon.

I have received the v-mail letter you wrote on April 28.  It came faster than usual.  I am pleased that you received the ring that I filed for you.  I was afraid that you would not receive it.  Are any of my letters censored?

I am now writing in my tent which I share with seven other officers.  A couple of days ago, this place was thick, nearly impenetrable jungle.  Now it has been transformed into a park.  It’s located on top of a small hill at whose edge a clear, cool, and murmuring creek is flowing.  I have been bathing in it daily and like it.  So far, I have not seen one mosquito, but many ants of all sizes.  The weather has been good.  The nights are cool.  I need two blankets and something else to keep me warm.  

The food is fair, but I like the abundance of fresh fruit that this hilly country is providing for us.  I have eaten oranges every day.  These oranges are larger and sweeter than those I used to eat at home.  The natives bring the fresh fruit to us.  They exchange it for canned food like canned meat.  They like it and are willing to exchange one can of meat for 30 or 40 large oranges.  We have plenty of pawpaws.  These taste like melons, but are sweeter.  A moment ago, I drank a cup of coconut milk.  I think you would like it.  Someday we will drink it together.  

I do not know how long I’ll be here, nor do I care, because I like it.  I like any place where I can eat fruit.  And any place is the same to me when I am not with you.  

I am feeling fine.  My feet had a couple of blisters and my legs were tired and bitten by chiggers.  Now they are improving and feel much better.  From now on I’ll have an easy life for a while and maybe from now on.

Soon, it will be your birthday.  I am sorry I cannot buy a present for you, not even money.  When I receive my check, maybe it will be too late.  I am wishing you a Happy Birthday and hope that you and I will celebrate the next one together.

I love you and adore you.

										I am all yours,

My darling and beloved Annette,

I have received your v-mail letter of May 2 and your air mail letter of April 6 on the same day. 

I wish that the news you sent me that the men who served 15 months in the South Pacific area will go home for a furlough were true.  I have an idea when I’ll leave this place (I mean New Guinea).  However, I don’t care to go to any other place and it may as well be this one if I don’t have a chance to go home.  Oh, to be home with you! 

I think, darling, you are mistaken.  The truth is that I can do everything Gino can do, but he cannot do what I can do.  Only the best medical officers are sent here.  Those that have any defects are kept back.  

I am feeling fine and I am enjoying myself.  I like it here.  It is like a vacation for me.  The climate is similar to that of New England in September, cool nights and warm days.  I go bathing daily and get my sun treatment for an hour or two.  The food is good and the fruit is plentiful.  My chances to get hurt or injured are at least 50% less than yours.  The chiggers and the mosquitoes and the rats and the Japs are not bothering us at all for the simple reason that they are not around.

I am going to inquire about those courses you mentioned as soon as I am out of New Guinea.  Meanwhile, there is no way to find out about it.  It would take a century to receive or hear an answer.  

I cannot tell you how many times you come to my mind daily.  I do not say to my heart because you are always there, day and night, in my daydreams and night dreams and even when I am not dreaming.  I love you.

I’ll not send you any money for some time.  I have not been paid for the last five months because I refused to sign my pay voucher.  I did not know what to do with the money and there were no facilities to send it to you.

Until the next letter, I am all yours,

										Silvio

P.S.	My letters may not come regularly for a while because of the problems of communication.

My darling Annette,

A man is going to the post office within a short time.  I’ll take the chance to write you a few lines.  

I am in the same place and feeling fine.  As I told you in my previous letters, I am comfortable now.  I am enjoying a good vacation even though officially it is supposed to be hard.  

I do not like today.  It’s a rainy, cloudy day.  It rained most of the night.  However, I should not complain because the weather has been very good lately.

My time is taken partially by my professional work, reading, practicing phonetics, eating and sleeping.  I can sleep ten hours straight without interruption.  I like these cool nights.

How are you, darling?  You are moving into the summer and hot weather.  Do not work too hard.  

I have received bags of soup you sent.  I am going to use them.  I have not received your soap yet.  I do not care and do not need it now.  The Red Cross has been furnishing us with all the soap we need.  I received two cakes of soap from Dad.  

The Reader’s Digest is reaching me regularly, sometimes late.  

I am still smoking.  I do not know how long I will keep it up.  Someday I’ll get tired of it.  

Since I have been here, I am growing a mustache.  There is a competition among the officers about who is going to raise the best mustache.  My mustache is coming along well and gives me a professional touch.  I am not trimming it.  

I am eating my usual amount of fresh fruit.  

How is everybody at home?  Oh, how I wish I could come home and be with you!  Where did you hear that the men who served more than fifteen months overseas are sent home?  It will not take too long for me to be overseas fifteen months, one month and a fraction of the second to go.  I have hope that someday I’ll come back home.  We must be patient, but the day will come.  I am looking forward to it and imagine what we will do and where we will go.  We have to make up for all the time we lost, n’est-ce pas?

I love you and am all yours.

My darling Annette,

A car is going to the post office and I’ll take this chance to send you this note.  I have not received any news from you for a few days.  I received you last letter of May 9 four days ago.

I am feeling fine.  All is quiet around here.  This is really a good vacation for me.  It is like being in the country for a summer vacation.

My watch is not working as it should.  I would like you to send me one, not very expensive.  I would like to have a Webster’s dictionary.  I keep on practicing my phonetics.  I hope that by the end of the war, I’ll be able to speak very well.  It’s something to do that keeps me busy and interrupts the monotony of life.

I wish I were able to come home and be with you.  It’s my life long wish.  I am always thinking of you and I love you very, very much.

										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

I am answering your letters.  It was a grand day for me yesterday when I came back to my camp.  I received all the air mail letters you sent me from April to the middle of May plus v-mail letters.  The last v-mail was dated May 20!

I congratulate you on having worked six months without losing a single day.  You are wonderful.  

Soon, twenty-six days from today, it will be your birthday.  I’m sorry that I will not be able to send you a telegram as I desire.  I am going to send you some money with which you can buy a gift.  It is not much.  It is all I have had with me since my last pay of January 1, 1943.  I hope I will get paid soon.  Otherwise, I’ll be completely broke.  This does not mean a thing here because there is no way or place to spend a cent here.

I had a good three weeks rest in one of the most beautiful spots of this island.  A lovely breeze was blowing all day.  Nice green lawns were studded with orange, pawpaw, coffee, corn, and coconut trees.  The scenery was wonderful.  If you were with me, it would have been ideal.  

I am wishing you a very Happy Birthday!

I love you very, very much.


										I am all yours,

My darling and beloved wife,

I wish you a very Happy Birthday and many, many more.  It is understood and wished that you should pass your future birthdays after the coming one with me.  If only I could fly home and be with you and give you a Happy Birthday kiss!  Nobody in the world would be happier than I.  I hope, yearn, and keep on wishing that someday we will be happy again together.  Do you know that I start to daydream about what we will do and where we will go when we meet again?

How are you, my beloved?  Is the heat bothering you?  Is the work overbearing?  How are your mother, aunt, and uncle?

On our 16 month anniversary, I sent you by telegram all the money I had saved from my check of January 1, 1943.  It’s your birthday present from me.

As usual I am feeling fine except for a few chigger bites that are itching.  I am going to get rid of them soon.

I am back to what I call my New Guinea home after having passed three weeks in an ideal place.  If only you were present!  A lovely hill, whose lawns were mowed, was covered with orange trees carrying big sweet oranges, lemon trees, and coconut trees.  A gentle breeze was blowing all day long.  The scenery was miraculous and wonderful to behold.  It was a vacation for me.  I did not have any work to do, at the most five minutes after breakfast.  The cool, quiet nights were just made for deep and restorative sleep.  However, I have not gained any weight.  I am keeping my weight steady at the summer level.

I have been in New Guinea for nearly five months now and marvelous to say (I am knocking wood), I have not had one day of sickness, one line of temperature, lost one meal, had any trouble whatsoever.  Is that not wonderful!

I have not asked to be sent to the tropical diseases school.  I know I do not have a chance.  Moreover, I am needed here.  Do you know that if they give me permission to go to the school, they would send me to Australia and I do not care for that.  In Australia, it is winter now and I do not like cold and rainy days.  I had enough of those days a year ago.  I prefer it here.  

Do not worry, darling.  If I see or think that I have any chance to come home and see you, I am going to try to get home.  I am always keeping my eyes and ears opened.

I have read the poem you sent me.  I got a kick out of it.  It was a hit with all the men to whom I read it.  It’s all true with the exception of the dust that I never see and the always clear sky.  Today it is a wonderful summer day, but a few day ago it rained and poured incessantly.  Today, darling, is a grand day.  It’s like one of those days we enjoyed in summer time in Lowell.  This brings me many, many sweet memories.

Again, darling, I wish you a very Happy Birthday and a special one hour kiss.

I am all yours and I do love you very, very much.

My darling and beloved Annette,

During the past week, I have sent you some money by telegram.  I sent you two checks, one for $70., the other for $730.  I wanted to send you something for your birthday that reached you in time.  I remember that last year my gift reached you a long time after your birthday and spoiled it.  I do hope that this year I’ll be in time.  Two days ago I received my pay for the service rendered during the last five months.  I sent all I got as a sign of my love and trust.  I cannot tell you how much I would like to kiss you on your birthday.  I’ll send you a million kisses and many, many more.  I love you, my beloved wife, and adore you immensely.

It’s Sunday here, a beautiful Sunday, full of sun and light.  A breeze is blowing.  It is not warm, nor cold.  The nights are wonderful.  If you were here, you would love it.  New Guinea is not as bad as the papers describe it.  I do prefer this place to Australia and I prefer to remain here instead of going down there for the winter.  

Darling, I am not alone.  Everybody here wants and yearns to come home.  When a man is discharged and sent home, it means that he is no good.  I know that you are proud of your husband and you want him to be a good man and do his duty.  I feel that I am needed here.  I know that it does require sacrifice on your part and on mine, but we must do something so that tomorrow, when peace comes, we can proudly say that we did our part.  It will take time, but I am sure that I will come back to you to live and enjoy the rest of our lives together.  Our happiness will be greater.  We will appreciate our company much more.  I’ll have plenty of stories to tell to our two dozen children, n’est-ce pas?  Will you keep you chin up, just for a little while longer?  Just for me?

How is your mother?  Do not worry about her.  She will live to be a hundred years old.  She did not have any high blood pressure when I saw her the last time.  She will be all right.

I received a letter from Dad yesterday.  He complains that my mail does not reach him in time.  He is glad, however, that you keep him informed.  Send him and Mother my regards.

Remember me to your people.  I love you very, very much.


										I am all yours,

My darling Annette,

It’s a pity to have such a beautiful, balmy day wasted.  It breaks my heart to have to pass these moonlit, cool, starry nights dreaming.  Last night, I was listening to a radio broadcast from San Francisco.  It came in clearly, as if the radio station was a few miles away.  The music gave me a deep feeling of loneliness, a yearning to be home and back with you.  I do not think it is fair to keep us apart so long.  I am wishing and hoping that this yearning will be fulfilled someday.

I am feeling very well, have a good appetite, and sleep like a log.  I really mean it when I say that I do not have any physical complaints.  I only wish that I could be able to be with you on your birthday.

Again, I wish you a very Happy Birthday.

I love you immensely and I am all yours.

My darling Annette,

One more day and then it will be 14 months since I kissed you the last time.  Fourteen long months!  How many more?  I miss you, darling, as much today as I did the day I sailed.  I think more.  Yes, I know I miss you more and love you more deeply.

Your letters are coming in regularly.  Yesterday, I received the letter you wrote June 6.  It took only 13 days!

I am sorry to have caused you to worry about my leg.  It was only a big blister on my left heel.  It heeled in a few days.  This is the only ailment I have had since I have been in New Guinea.  Is it not wonderful!

How is your leg?  Is your injury healed?  I told you that you go through more hardship and danger than I do.  Take good care of yourself, will you, darling?

Do you remember the days we passed in Texas?  Do you remember the cloudless sky, the moonlit nights, and the balmy climate?  This is what I am experiencing now, but you are not with me and this makes a great difference.  The difference that exists between happiness and unhappiness.  Someday when the war is over, and I hope before, we will be together again.

Would you like to know how I pass my time?  I have won my battle with the rats.  Last week, I caught half a dozen.  Since then, I have not caught one, nor found any footprints in my tent.  I am glad of that.  The ants have been a nuisance, but the Chaplain is taking care of those.  One mosquito is around once in a while, but not many.

I have built a chair by using wood, nails, and my too-worn pants.  It is a nice, small, light chair and comfortable to sit on.  I am going to use it when I go to the movies.  We have a show nearly every week now.  Our movie house consists of the sky, the ground, a screen and a projector.  Everybody has to carry his own chair.  I have used a box so far.  I change now to a comfortable chair.

I am studying and practicing phonetics daily.  My improvement is not great, but gradual and steady.  I know very well that perfection is still a long way off, but it is fun to do something.  I enjoy and like it.  It keeps my mind busy on something.

I am feeling fine and have no complaints except that I would like to come back home.

Will you consider every cent of the amount of money I sent you as a kiss from me to you for your birthday?
I love you and I am all yours.

My darling Annette,

I have received your letter of June 11.  The mail service is now beyond reproach.  I hope that it will continue in the same way.  It makes me feel good to receive your mail and read it.  My morale jumps to a high peak when it previously was down in the dumps.

How are you, my darling?  It is warm at home?  And at work?  We are having a spell of cool weather, relatively speaking.  During the last couple of days, we had a temperature that varied between 65 and 75 degrees.  The climate is like that of Bermuda.  

I am feeling well as usual. Three days ago, I had a spell of diarrhea.  It lasted four hours, then I was all right again.  It was caused by the food.  Lately, I cannot complain about the food.  It has been good, as good as what we had in Australia.

I am doing my usual work.  I saw a picture last night, “The Pied Piper.”  I enjoyed it.  I like Monty Woolley.  This evening, we are going to have a U.S.O. show.

I listen to the news every night.  It is transmitted by short wave radio from San Francisco.  The war events have gone our way during the last eight months.  I hope they will continue to run in our favor.  I want to come home and live happily with my beloved wife.

Have you received the money I sent you?  I hope you will receive it before your birthday.  A week from tomorrow, you will celebrate it.  I do not know what I would give to be with you that day!  I will be thinking of you all day on that day.

Everything is fine here.  All is quiet and peaceful.  I am pursuing my hobby.

Always thinking of you and loving you immensely.

I kiss you and am all yours.

My darling Annette,

Tomorrow is your birthday.  I wish I were with you!  I hope that next year we may be able to celebrate it together somewhere in the good old U.S.A. 

I have received your v-mail of June 18 in which you tell me of your visit to Connecticut and of having enjoyed yourself.  I think you should take all the occasions you have during the summer to breathe some fresh air and get some sunshine.  It will help you to prevent the winter colds.

I wish I could be able to take you out into the country and show you a good time.  Someday, I hope, we will be able to realize this dream.

I am feeling fine with the exception of one finger of my left hand that I sprained yesterday while playing volleyball.  My team lost.  This afternoon, I am going to try very hard to win the game.  

Loving you deeply, I am all yours,

										July 3, 1943


Happy Birthday, my darling wife, and many, many more, but every one with me!  I hope and wish that you will have a good time and enjoy yourself with your relatives and friends.

Last night, I received your telegram.  It does not say when you sent it.  I do not know which money you got, the first or second check or both.  Soon, I’ll know.  A letter from you is due any day now.

From your telegram, I guess that you are worrying about me.  I do believe that this war is worse on you and my folks than it is for me.

Here I am feeling fine, enjoying the good weather, eating good food, and seeing movies or shows nearly every other evening.  The only thing that bothers me is the middle finger of my left hand.  I strained it yesterday playing volleyball.  The other thing that bothers me is that my team loses more games than it wins.  We are improving, however.  We play every afternoon.

I sent you that money because I do not want to carry it with me and lose it.  I’ll send you some more next month.  I do not have a chance to spend it here.  The only money I need is to pay for my haircuts and to pay the man who takes care of my quarters and my laundry.

You should see our victory garden!  The tomato plants are all in bloom.  We will have fresh tomatoes within a short time.

Last night, I saw “Here Slept George Washington” a comedy that I enjoyed only partly.
I do not like to see the same trick played and replayed in the same movie.  We have built an up-to-date open air theater with seats for the officers and all the trimmings.  

I listen to the news from San Francisco every night.  Olson and I go to see an officer who has a short wave radio.  Olson, as I told you, is my assistant.  He is very tall, 6 feet, 3 inches.  I am 5 feet, 8 inches.  The seven inch difference has given us the nickname “the short and the tall.”  This is the nickname by which we are known.  The Chaplain does not like to listen to the news.  He reads in the evenings or writes sermons.  He is kept very busy and is doing good work.  

It’s a pleasure to be here.  I like it better here in New Guinea than in Australia.  It’s much better and life is easier.  Australia offers the soldier liquor, women, movies and golf.  I do not care for liquor, nor for women (I love my wife too much).  What I miss is golf.  Volleyball takes its place here.  I get as much of a kick playing volleyball as I did playing golf.  I can see more movies here than I did in Australia.  All in all, I’m better off here.  As far as danger is concerned, there is as much danger here as there is at home or in Australia.  Sometimes life is even too monotonous.  We go weeks and weeks without any excitement.

The news has been going our way and is still going our way and will keep on going our way.  Conditions have changed remarkably since we parted.  They have completely.  The sides have turned and our chances are good.

My darling wife, I renew my heartily felt wishes for a hundred more birthdays.

Have a special kiss from me and many more.

I am all yours body and soul.

My darling wife,

Another day to remember is passing by and we do not enjoy celebrating it together.  It is seventeen months today.  I am wondering how many anniversaries shall pass before we will be able to have one together.  It is not fair that we enjoyed only two together.   But, I have hopes and am looking forward to the good times ahead that we will have.

I miss you more than ever.  I love you so much and don’t think I can live much longer without being with you.

I adore you.  As I was seventeen months ago, I am all yours.

My darling Annette,

I am sorry that you had not received any mail from me for two weeks when you wrote me your last letter.  I have been writing to you regularly, especially during the month of June.  I wrote you often because I wanted you to receive mail on and around your birthday.  I am glad you got my check.  I sent you another one a couple of days before.  I hope you received that too.  It was only $70.

I am sure that you have plenty of heat at home now and you will be suffering from it.  I have some advice to give you.  Take plenty of salt in your food.  I do not mind the heat.  I thrive in warm climates.  

Here everything is fine.  I am feeling tops.  I guess that I am putting on some weight.  I have a nice tan.  I spent a week at a beach, taking sunbaths.  It was a good vacation.  I have been drinking plenty of coconut milk lately.  If you were here, I am sure you would enjoy this country because it’s new and the climate is wonderful now in what is supposed to be winter time.

I am missing you, darling, immensely and always.  I am always yearning and longing for the day when I’ll land on the U.S. shore and come home to you.

I hope you received all my mail and had a lovely birthday.

Remember me to your mother, aunt and uncle.

I love you and adore you.

My darling Annette,

This month, I have not written to you as often as I should or better would have.  I have been roaming around nearly the whole month.  Now I am settled and I do hope not for long. 

I am going to try to go to the school for tropical diseases.  So far, I have not found any regulations about it.  Will you please send me the information regarding this course?  Hearsay does not mean a thing in the Army.  They want to have regulations, etc.  It’s only now that I am in a position to inquire about it.   I would appreciate, however, if you would make inquiries at the Red Cross and try to obtain specific information. 

How are you, my beloved Annette?  I have not received any news from you for a long time.  Your last letter that I received two weeks ago was dated June 23.  I have been here for a few days.  Today, it’s the first day that the post office is working.

I am feeling in the best of health.  It’s surprising to have been in the tropics for more than six months and not have suffered a headache, a rash, or a day of fever.   I have been in the best of health.  I am glad to be back in Australia.  You needed some rest from worrying.  From now on, you will not be worried about me.  I am far away from any danger now and you do not have to worry.  I am going to spend my free time at the golf links.  Now I’ll be able to use the golf balls you sent me last Christmas.   But I wish I could come home.

I had a wonderful trip coming down here.  I don’t know why but every time everything is going fine with me, I am missing you more than ever.  I know I’ll never be fully happy until I will be back with you and hold you in my arms.  Do not forget, do not put on too much weight.  With the good food I am getting now, I’ll put back the couple of pounds I lost in New Guinea.

The weather is similar to that you will enjoy this coming fall during the month of October.  The nights are cool.  I sleep in my sleeping bag plus four woolen blankets.  It is not excessively cold, but I have lived for months in the tropics and am not used to cold weather.  As I mentioned, the food I am eating now is excellent, the best I have eaten since I have been in the Armed Forces.

The men are resting now, but I am taking care of my men as usual.  There is no rest for the Army doctors.  I am proud to say that the men I took care of are the healthiest men that ever left the tropics.  I have beaten my record.  My commanding officer told me that my record is a good one and something to be proud of.  

Have you gone to see my folks?  If you did, how are they?  Do they look older?

How are your mother, aunt, and uncle?

Yesterday, I heard the good and very welcome news that Mussolini has been relieved of his position.  Thank God, one gangster is out of the scene of history.  I hope that the Italian people will soon enjoy the freedom that has been denied to them for the last long twenty years.

The war is going well this year.  Tell your coworkers not to slacken their efforts, but to increase production.  We want to end this war victoriously and to go home soon for good.  I know that if all the workers were like you, production would jump by leaps and bounds.

Darling, I love you.  Today, I sent you a telegram.  I hope you will receive it during the intermission of my letters.

I love you immensely and am all yours.

										August 5, 1943

My darling Annette,

Your letters came.  I received as many as six within twenty-four hours.  I was anxious to know how you were.  I have not received the long letter you had promised to write me from Connecticut yet.  I have received the last package of chicken soup you sent me.  I really do not need it now.  I’ll keep it in reserve for bad days.

We are eating very well now.  Indeed, the food is so good that yesterday I came back from town to eat my supper.  The Aussies do not eat such good food in their best hotels.  I am, by the way, not so keen about their cooking.  I weigh 160 pounds.

Last Sunday, I went to visit Mr. Taylor and family.  I went after supper.  I called him by phone the day before and misunderstood him.  He had invited me to tea.  I had forgotten that by tea the Aussies mean supper.  When I reached his house, I was full of good food and could not eat any more.  Do you know what he had prepared for me?  Roast chicken!  He called it fowl, but it looked like chicken to me.  Was I sore at myself!  I haven’t tasted chicken for many months and I was so full I could not eat any more.  I had a good time because I could talk to them about my recent experiences in New Guinea.  

I am going to play golf soon.  I received my footlocker today from the place where I had it stored.  I have all the golf balls you sent me for Christmas.  I have not used them yet, but I am going to soon.  While I was away, Mr. Taylor won two trophies.  He is an excellent golfer.  He gave me a few pointers before.

Funny how the world is!   You ar  sweating in the excessive heat and I am shivering in the cold.  Evenings and nights and mornings are cold.  Thanks to my sleeping bedroll and many woolen blankets, I sleep comfortably all night.  I have my winter coats and sweaters.  I feel the cold worse this year than I did a year ago.  I have been in the tropical weather for ten months and the cold has been a novelty, not so welcome.  Give me hot weather anytime.  I like it.  During the day, it’s comfortably warm.

I have sent in the application for the course in tropical diseases.  I do not know how it will go.  I am sorry, but I do not have high hopes.  I prefer to be pessimistic rather than over optimistic.  

Since I came down, I have been rather homesick and missing you more than ever.  My yearning to be back is so strong that it causes me to suffer.  I don’t have to work hard now.  Life is easy and our superiors are trying their best to make us happy.  But who wants happiness in Australia?  I hate idleness away from home.  I want to go back home.  What do they think we are made of, steel without any feelings?  A few weeks at home would make all the difference.

We are fixing our camp.  I have a tent for myself.  I am enjoying the luxury of having a floor made of smooth boards like that at home.  Soon, I’ll have electric lights.  By the end of the month, the cold season will be over and I’ll be able to enjoy all the comforts of home.  But what good to me are all these comforts when I am missing you?

I am glad that I am back in Australia because I know that you’ll stop worrying about me.  I am safe now, far, far away from any danger, far and beyond the reach of any Jap assault.  As for myself, I was happier in New Guinea.  It gives me a pang to see people happily walking through the streets with their wives or sweethearts.  I am, yes, envious of other people’s happiness.  I want some too and I think I deserve it even though Uncle Sam does not try to give it to me.  But someday I’ll be home.  We will have our silver lining.  The war is moving in our favor and my hopes are soaring high.  It will take some time yet, but victory and home and more than anything else in the whole world, you, will be with me.

I love and adore you, darling.

I am all yours body and soul.

My darling Annette,

I have received your letter of July 29 this morning.  I am glad to know that my telegram reached you within three days after I sent it.  I sent it the day after I reached this camp.  During the preceding ten days, I was unable to mail any letters to you because of lack of post office facilities.  I wanted to close that gap with a telegram.  I did not want you to worry about me while I was enjoying safety, good food, and long nights of sleep in cold weather.  I had inquired at the Censor Department of our unit if it was permissible to tell or send by telegram the news that I arrived in Australia.  I was told that I could. You can imagine how angry I became when I read that my words “Arrived in Australia safe and whole -  Love” were transferred or translated to the prosaic, vulgar, stupid expression “AM OKAY.”  The translator should have his brains examined or be relieved from his position for gross incompetency.  I have cursed him all day.  Instead of giving you relief, it caused you more worry.  If I had a chance to meet the fellow, I would take care of him.  I sent you “love” and he cheated me out of that too.  Moreover, he stole three words.  I call it a case of petty larceny.

I am sorry that I misunderstood you when you said that you went out of Lowell.  I do not know where I got the idea that you went to Connecticut for the weekend.

I have not received the watch and the book.  I do expect them, however.  When I read that the only watches for sale cost $95. or more, I was afraid you had bought one.  But you have much more sense than that and you really did what I would have done if I were in your position.  I know I have a wonderful wife.  I told a Westerner today that in the East, we have the best girls in the United States and I told him, to be more specific, I know very well a lady in New England and that she is without question the best girl in the whole world.  Nobody will ever be better than she is.

We are accumulating some money.  We’ll really need it, all of it, when I come home to you.  I am very glad that you take good care of it and have as much ambition as I have to see it growing.  

I have applied for a course in tropical diseases at Walter Reed Hospital.  I am curious to see what they will answer.  Anyhow, the authorities will know that I feel the need of a refresher course.  It is not fair to keep a man in the field for years and years and expect him to be as good as one that passes all his time in a hospital.  I agree with you that there is plenty of injustice.  It makes me mighty sore just to think of it.  

I hope that his darn war will come to an end soon and I will be able to come back home.  I have been overseas for nearly 16 months.  I have been married a year and a half and passed only ten weeks with you.  I want to come back.  I want to be with you.  I miss you all the time.

Life is going on as usual.  Not much to do.  I read all day long and go to a movie at least every other night.  I go to sleep early because of the cold.  

Do you remember six years ago during this month?  I could see you any time of the day then and I was very happy to see you.  I know now how very happy I was.

I love you, darling, and am all yours.

									Somewhere in Australia
									August 18, 1943


My darling Annette,

Since ten o’clock this morning, I have been wearing on my left wrist the watch you sent me.  I am going to use the word you used in your letter dated August 2 from Larchmont.  It’s lovely.  I have been showing it off all day.  It’s really lovely and I like it very much.  It signs now 6:24 P.M. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I needed it and moreover, it came from you.  This makes it a great deal more dear to me.  In the same package, I got the dictionary.  The last edition.  Wonderful!  I’ve already used it.  It will be my friend from now on.  I send you a kiss for every word I’ll read in it.  I use it many times daily.  I do not mean for every word I’ll look for, but for every word I’ll read in it.

I’m glad you went to see the folks.  You did not tell me how you found them.  Do they look older to you?  It pleases me a great deal to read that you like a house located in the woods outside the noisy streets.  It’s what I am dreaming of, a house among the green trees to share with you for the rest of our days when the war is over.

I do not know when that will become a reality.  I hope soon.  The picture of the international situation is much brighter now than it ever was before.  It’s quite different from that of a year ago.  I used to wait for news with a feeling of apprehension and fear.  It was disheartening to listen to bad news day after day.  It did hurt me terribly because I knew it meant a longer period of time that I had to live away from you.  But, now it’s different.  Thanks to our troops and allies and especially to the heroic Russians, we are moving inexorably towards victory.  

Last night, I had the first glass of wine since last year.  It made me remember the wine we drank together at Little Rock and Olympia.  Do you remember that at Little Rock you felt upset after you drank some of it?

Yesterday was my first afternoon off.  I ate my first meal outside an Army camp since last year.  I had fried chicken in a Chinese restaurant run by Chinese people.  It was excellent chicken.  I was served by a Chinese girl, very sweet and no more than ten years old.  She had very good manners.  She and two more sisters of about the same age are serving the customers and they are doing a good job too.

I played golf alone.  My friends are becoming soft.  They cannot take it.  I took a caddy with me.  He and I talked a great deal.  He told me all about local politics and that John Curtin is a good leader and should be reelected.  The Aussies are holding their national election the day after tomorrow.

I am recalling to my memory August 1937.  I’ll have many, dear memories to recollect from now on.  And they were the happiest days of my life.  I was then very happy.  I was totally happy.  To have met you and known you was the greatest thrill of my life.  Soon it will be six years since our first trip to Boston where we saw “The Life of Zola.”

I wasn’t in New Guinea long enough to enjoy the tomatoes.  However, I do not regret it.  We have plenty of them here.  

We are still getting good food.  I have not put on much weight.  I am 160 pounds.  During the New Guinea campaign, I went down to 150 pounds, but regained it during the rest period.  I am feeling fine, doing my work and plenty of reading.  This takes care of all my exuberant mental energy.

From now on, you will not be bothered by warm weather and you will not sweat much.  It will be too cold.  I sleep now with three blankets.  I have discarded my woolen sweaters for many days from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.  I dare say that spring is around the corner.

Darling, have all my love.


										I am all yours,

										Australia
										August 23, 1943


My darling Annette,

I am still complaining and feeling in the mood to punch the censor in the nose.  I received today your letter of August 10.  You are still worrying about me and listening to the news that comes from New Guinea with apprehension.  You are still wondering where I am and why I do not write.  It makes me angry to think that all this mental anguish could have been prevented if the censor had not taken the liberty to translate my telegram into an expression never used by myself and not common in America.

As I wrote you previously, I was unable to mail you any letters for about two weeks, that is during the voyage to Australia and a few days after we landed.  I wired you because I wanted to cover that period of time.  I wrote you a long letter about a month ago.  You probably have received it, I hope.

Yesterday, I received four letters, two from you, one from Dad, and one from Lena.  It was as if I had received three letters from you because Dad wrote me about your visit to Larchmont.  He and Mother were very pleased.  They are very proud of their daughter-in-law!  I got today you v-mail letter of August 10 and that made it a perfect couple of days.

I received your letter a few minutes before I left for town.  I had made arrangements to meet Mr. Taylor to go to play golf.  Your letters did something to me.  They raised my morale sky high.  I was in high spirits all day.  Do you know that I played the best game of golf of all my golf career?  I broke a hundred!  I consider myself a fair player now.  And I am proud.  Do you mind if I write so much about golf?  It’s my hobby and there is nothing else that may attract my attention.  I like it.

I’ve stopped writing for a few minutes to read the two letters you wrote me before and on the way to Larchmont and the other on the way back home.  I unwrapped and opened the package you sent me some time ago containing concentrated soup, coffee, and candy.  I wish it had come while I was in New Guinea.  I have plenty of everything now.

Going back to yesterday, I want to tell you that it was a perfect day for me.  I had dinner and supper with the Taylors and their son and daughter-in-law.  Mr. Taylor is only a few years younger than my father.  He and his wife treat me very well.  I can go and see them any time I want.  They offered me a room and a bed.  I may use it any time I want.  I was told that it is my room.  They have three children, grown up and married.  They took me for an afternoon ride in their car.  It was a short ride due to the gasoline shortage, but I enjoyed it.  He and I have one thing in common.  We both like golf.  His son is a golfer too, but I play better than he does and yesterday I beat him.  They have a nice, clean house and their food is well cooked. Yesterday was the first time during this year that I ate at a table covered with a tablecloth and had a napkin to wipe my mouth.  I had a good home day.  They told me a great deal about Australia and their personal troubles and diseases.  In ordinary times, I would have been bored to death, but to me it was something new, a change from my ordinary daily routine.

When I came back, I felt terribly homesick.  It hurt me badly to think of all the pleasures of life I am missing.  I would pay anything to be home, to have a home to share with you.  I dreamed all night of future times when you and I, finally together and forever, will be living, eating, breathing, and dreaming together.  We will make up for all the time lost.  I am storing all my energies.

I do not envy Paul.  I would not like to have served in the Army on a limited service.  And I do not like to be a clerk, less a medical clerk.  At least I see the world.  When the war is over, I want to say that I did my part and took my chances.

It’s a beautiful day here, warm and sunny.  I am feeling fine, but for the feeling of loneliness and the yearning to see and meet and be with my very darling wife.

I love you immensely.

										I am all yours,


										Silvio


P.S.	The watch is running well.  I like it.  The dictionary is keeping me good company.



										Love,
										
										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Six years ago tonight, we were riding for the first time to Boston.  Do you remember?  It was Wednesday.  I met you at 6 P.M. You were late, only a few minutes.  You came and missed me, but you found me on your second time around.  Oh, do I wish I were back to six years ago!  Was I happy then!

I am disappointed.  The application I sent in came back today.  It was not approved.  Nobody is sent back to the United States from this war zone unless one is so sick that he will be a cripple for life or is disabled due to injury.  Tell those people who told you that men who have been overseas for fifteen months have a chance to go back home that it is a lie.  I wish it was true.  Men from other war zones may go back home, but we can’t.  We have to make the most of everything: be away from home for a long time, suffer all the torments of war against men, and endure the jungle and tropical weather.  

I feel in a bad mood tonight.  It’s not the way to celebrate one, no, the happiest anniversary of my life, the beginning of a new life.  I’ll get over my troubles tonight and pass into a world of dreams, a world that has no limits of space, nor of time.  I’ll be with you in dreamland tonight.

I am starting my seventh week out of the tropics.  I am feeling fine.  I am keeping healthy.  I put on weight.  I am studying phonetics again.  I am taking lessons from one of my men.  He taught English in high school before he was inducted in the Army and is very good, the best I have had.  He is helping me to improve my consonants.  It’s long, tedious work.  I like it and enjoy it.  It keeps my mind busy on something.  I know I have a long way to perfection, but I am trying...  I can read fairly well.  I am using the dictionary many times daily.   For every word I read, I send you a kiss.

My pajamas are starting to give in.  They will be transformed into rags soon.  Could you send me a pair?

I am enjoying the candy you sent me.  I saw many movies recently.  I am starting to be tired of them.  I am keeping busy during the day, doing one thing or another, but I always find time to think of you and to love you.

Have many, many kisses.


										I am all yours,
