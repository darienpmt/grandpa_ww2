My darling and beloved wife,

Yesterday, while on a walk at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, I was wishing you a Happy New Year.  I was trying to guess where you were and what you were doing.  I guess you were working while the hour struck the new year in, the year that maybe will bring peace to this world.  

I received your letter of December 15.  Did you receive my telegram of Season’s Greetings?  I received yours and thank you very much for it.  

Soon I am going to step up.  Monday, I guess, I’ll be Battalion Surgeon.  It’s a promotion.  The captaincy should follow it soon.  It will never be too soon for me.  I’ll let you know about it, darling.  

Here everything is fine.  I am feeling very well.  Eating and sleeping well.  If I could only have my wife with me, I would be the happiest man in the whole world.  

I love you, darling.



									I am all yours,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

I could not let this date pass without writing you at least a few lines.  Eleven months ago, we became husband and wife!  I wish I were back to those days that followed our wedding.  But I have hope that those happy days will come back again.

I have received your long letter of December 17.  When I read your letters, it is like hearing you talking.  I read and reread them many times.  I am sorry, darling, that I cannot answer many of your questions.  We have our shower room.  It is only a few yards from my bed.  We eat good food.  I am not in the same place where I was last week.  I moved half a mile.  

Lately, I have been quite busy.  I am holding a responsible position now.  I have been Battalion Surgeon since January 4, 1943.  My position ranks as a Captaincy.  I may get it.  The Colonel has been trying to get it for some time.  The trouble is that there are more captains than is required.  But, darling, I feel that it will not be long before I’ll be a Captain.  I’ll let you know as soon as I get it.

I include in this letter a nugget of Australian gold that Mr. Taylor gave to me on New Yea’s Eve.  I went to see him and his wife.  I brought him some cigarettes and sweets and he gave me the gold nugget.  You asked for one once.  You know that I will get everything for you if you give me time. 

If you’ll be patient, I will come back to you.  If it were up to me, I would have been home with you long, long ago.  I do yearn so much to be back, to kiss you, to cuddle you, to hold you in my arms so tight to my chest that it hurts me.

I do love you, darling.


									I am all yours forever,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

This morning, I received the letter that you sent on the cold day of the 20th of December, 1942.  This world is not well balanced.  You are suffering from extreme cold.  I am taking a shower a couple of times a day to keep myself cool.  I have to change my underwear often.  Otherwise, I smell.  I like this weather even if I have to drink one glass of water after another.  

Darling, I am feeling fine.  Being a Battalion Surgeon, I feel a little bit important.

I hope you’ll receive the nugget of gold I sent you by air mail.  Mr. Taylor gave it to me.  He likes American cigarettes that I do not smoke.  When I have them, I give them to him.  This is the reason why he always welcomes me to his house.  

Darling, nothing is new here.  I am still around the same place.  Sometimes the papers make me worry.  I know that some news makes you worry.  It is true that this war is worse on the civilian population than on the soldiers.  

Soon our first year of marital life will be at an end.  A second will start.  I do hope and wish and yearn that part of it I will be able to pass with you, my beloved wife.  I love you more and more.  Oh, if I could kiss you, I would be the happiest husband in the whole world.


									I am all yours,


									Silvio

My darling and beloved Annette,

Do you remember nine months ago when we bid each other goodbye at the white house in Olympia?  It is as clear in my mind as if it had happened yesterday.  Then as today there is a question in my mind.  How long shall I wait before I’ll be able to kiss you again, to hold you in my arms again, and to love and be happy again?  

How are you, my beloved wife?  I have not received any news from you for a few days.  I do not know how you enjoyed Christmas.  I’ll know it soon.  

I am feeling fine.  I have a good tan, good appetite, can drink gallons of water, and sleep long hours.  The trouble is that the night is sometimes too short.  

Lately I have seen many pictures.  For a while I went to the movies every night with a band of jolly officers.  It felt like I was a student again.  

How is your work coming along?  How are your mother, aunt, and uncle?  I am thinking often of you and trying to imagine what you are doing. 

Darling, I love you very, very much.  A million kisses.


										I am all yours,


										Silvio

My beloved wife,

Eighteen more days may be the time required for this letter to reach you.  A year, our first year of married life, will end and the second one will be ushered in.  I do wish and pray and yearn that during our second year of marital life we will be able to have a longer time together, to be happy together much longer than ten short weeks.  They cannot keep us separate too long.  Am I not fighting for the freedom and happiness of suffering humanity?  Am I not fighting for the family?  They cannot keep us separate too long.  We are doing our duty.  They cannot ask too much sacrifice from us.  Darling, I am going to do my utmost to come to you and be with you during our second year.  I love you.



								
									Always and forever yours,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

Late last night I read four v-mail letters that you sent me on December 30 and 31 and January 3 and 6.  I reread all of them this morning as soon as it was daylight.  

I am glad that you find your position a good pastime even if it makes your life harder.  Soon you’ll be quite stylish with all the weight you’re losing!  Be careful not to become too skinny.

I am now somewhere in New Guinea.  I’ll tell you about it when I come back home.  I just ate my first coconut.  I say I ate it but to be exact I should say that I drank it too.  Yesterday I had a swim and this time I also washed myself.

I’ll be thinking of you on our first anniversary.

The Colonel is trying to do his best to give me a promotion.  I hope he will succeed.  
Life over here  is not as bad as it is described.   

I am thinking often of you and wishing to be able to be back home with you.  I love you, my darling wife, very, very much.  

Did Dad write to you?  I have not heard from him for a while.

I love you with all my heart.  Have millions and millions of kisses.

My darling and beloved wife,

Another six days, then it will be a year since you changed your name to mine.  I wish it were a year ago and I would be able to relive our ten honeymoon weeks!

How are you, darling?  I have not received any news from you lately.  But I am satisfied.  Days ago I received a letter of yours dated January 6, 1943.

I am sorry that you have a skin rash.  Maybe it’s due to the materials you handle.  Did you try to use gloves?  I know what it means to work at night.  I am really sorry that you have to go through such a hardship.  On the other hand, I do not blame you.  It’s a new experience.
  
I am carrying on as usual here.  Life is the same for me.  Nothing especially new that you won’t read in the papers.  I am feeling fine and keep on sleeping a long, deep sleep.

Do you know that the bananas are more expensive here, where they grow naturally, than they were in New York in peace time?  The natives are trying to become rich at our expense.  We just do not buy them. 

You should see the curly and black hair of the natives!  I have to admit, however, from what I hear, that they have a sound moral code based maybe too much on force.  If anybody breaks the rules of the tribe, nothing but death is the punishment.  They wear only a pair of shorts or a cloth.  Men wear earrings or flowers in their hair.  I have not seen a female yet.  I will tell you some more next time.

I send you a kiss as big as the Pacific Ocean.


									I adore you,

My darling Annette,


As maybe you noticed from my address, I have changed my title.   So, from now on, when you have a chance to talk or write to your friends, you can say: “My husband, Captain Tontar.”  I don’t have to tell you that I really earned it.  It was not given to me because I shook hands with or bought drinks for my superior officers as some men we know did in old times.  I had to work hard for it.  I hope this will make you very happy.

I am feeling fine, darling.  The weather is not cold.  On the contrary, it is warm, but not so warm that I cannot stand it.  

As you know, I am in New Guinea.  I cannot tell you where.  You can read the newspapers.  They will tell you everything you want to know about this country.  

How are you, darling?  Your husband is adoring you.  He takes your picture wherever he goes.

I love you.


									All yours,

My darling wife,

A year ago today, soon after we came out of the chapel, I kissed you and told you: “My wife!”  Out of fifty-two weeks, we had only ten together, but in spirit we were always together all year round.  Today while we start our second year, I do hope that we will be able to be together more than ten weeks.  I wish we could be together all year.

How are you, darling?  Here it is a glorious day.  Not a cloud in the sky!  What a difference from a year ago.  Though it was raining and cold, I was much happier then.

Lately I had some new experiences.  I flew for the first time in my life.  It was a thrilling moment when I was in the air for the first time.  I was afraid and excited at the same time.  The height gave me an awful feeling of helplessness.  Then I liked it and enjoyed the scenery so much that I would have liked the trip to last longer.  It was like riding in a car.  At a certain height in the air, it became cooler.  It made the bottle of lemonade I had with me a cold drink for when I landed.

I am feeling very well.  Today I worked around my sleeping place after I had taken care of the usual sick call.  I made a washing stand, a place to stand and shave.  I took a good sponge bath, shaved and brushed my teeth, and got ready to write my darling wife. 

Today it is our day.  Oh, how I wish I were able to kiss you today as I did a year ago!  I love you now as deeply and more than I did a year ago.  I yearn and long to be with you and love you, my beloved wife.  Hoping and wishing for the day of our reunion.

I am all yours.


										Always and forever,

My darling and beloved wife,

It is a very pleasant evening here.  I had my daily bath and supper and shaved and brushed my teeth.  Now, I am ready to be with you.  It’s Saturday evening here in New Guinea.  It’s early Saturday morning at home and maybe you are fast asleep.  

Last night, I dreamt all night about you.  We were living at home and having a very good time!  It will not be long!  The news coming in is favorable and we are not afraid anymore.  Here everything is quiet and peaceful.  Do not worry about me because I am better off than you are.  You are suffering from snow and cold while I am comfortable.  

Now that I am a Captain, my morale is very high and I like to show off my double bars.  I had to wait for my promotion but I got it.  I did not go after it.  I just did my duty.  The Colonel went after it and got it for me.  Berger tried to get it by nagging and asking people.  He is still a lieutenant.  

My darling wife, I am feeling well.  How are you?  I love you deeply.  I only wish I could be with you as I was a year ago.  I adore you.

											
										I am all yours,


										Silvio




P.S.	I lost my fountain pen.  Please send me one, concentrated soup, and soap.

My darling Annette,

It is Valentine’s Day and I was not able to send you a card asking you to be my Valentine.  It’s our second one.  I do wish it were the first and I was back in Carlisle.  It’s one year and one week that we have been married. 

A short pause.  I had to change place due to the rain.  It is raining now as it was that Sunday evening of November many years ago.  But, you are not here with me and I feel lonesome though I am surrounded by a crowd of men.  

How are you, darling?  I have not received any news from you since February 5.  The day I became a Captain, I wish I could have sent you a telegram announcing my promotion.  I was and am not able to do it.  I am too far from civilization.  I am not complaining, however.  I am hoping that this will keep on.  I am not in love with this country, but I do not mind it.  It has some good points.  I can drink or eat coconut fruit every day if I want to.  It costs me a couple of cigarettes to pay the local boys to climb the coconut trees and pluck the coconuts.  I don’t care for the milk, but I like the white, sweet, hard crust that keeps the coconut milk in good condition.

Occasionally, I see New Guinea people.  They are not tall, are black, and have beautiful curly, black hair.  Some of them are horrible to look at.  They wear shorts.  The women wear gowns from the belt down.  The chests of men and women are naked.  They live in huts and eat fruits or an animal that they kill occasionally.  They are very friendly to us and like us more than any other people on earth.  Whenever I meet them, I am greeted with a “Good Day.”  

I am working as usual and like my work.  I am feeling fine and have a good appetite.  Having nothing to do, I go to sleep early at night and can I sleep and dream about my wife!

Darling, I love you.

My darling Annette,

It was indeed a grand day for me last evening.  I have received your v-mail letters of January 17, 21, 25 and 31, 1943 and an air mail letter of January 10, 1943.  It made a wonderful day.  I have been very happy since I read them.  For two weeks, I did not receive any mail and as you know, I was wondering.  It was not your fault, but that of the mail service which is not always satisfactory.  

I cannot talk about the weather, but I can tell you that I do not suffer from cold weather.  It’s nice and cool in the mornings and can I sleep soundly then!  

How are you, darling?  I am sorry about your hands, but I assure you that with a few days rest you will have as lovely hands as you had before.  

Some of the questions you asked me have been answered in previous letters.  I know that you are as glad as I am about my promotion, even a little proud.  You wanted it as badly as I did, n’est-ce pas?  

I am receiving the Reader’s Digest regularly.  I received all the Christmas parcels you sent and I ate the package of fruit just the other day and was it good!  I still have some peanuts.  I am eating them sparingly. 

It takes six weeks for your air mail letters to reach me and three weeks for the v-mail letters.  I used some of the air mail stamps.  Others were spoiled by the excessive humidity in the air.  

I am feeling fine, have a good appetite, and try to do my work as best as I can.  My morale has been high since my promotion.  

I cannot tell you how much I love you and how eager I am to come back home and be with you as I was a year ago.


										I love you.

My darling and beloved wife,

Is it true that there is a bill before Congress that will limit the foreign service of the Armed Forces to fourteen months of foreign duty?  I hope it becomes law.  It would help in keeping up the morale of the men in the service forces and strengthen family ties.  All wives, mothers, and sweethearts are and will be thankful for such a law.

Darling, I received today the v-mail letters of February 3 and 5 and your lovely Valentine card.  Darling, you should not worry about me.  I am feeling tops.  I can take the heat, have a good appetite, and did not lose any weight.  I am kept busy and like the work.  It helps to pass the time very quickly and shortens the period of time that separates me from my darling and charming wife.  It is not bad here.  We have carved a nice place to live from the jungle.  

Last week, I enjoyed a movie “ Dance, Girl, Dance” under a tropical sky festooned by the tall coconut trees.

Darling, I tell you again, do not worry about me.  My love for you is growing with the days.  There is no other woman in the world that I love and adore but my own wife.


										I love you.

I received today the v-mail letter you wrote on January 19.  A few days ago, I received letters you sent me seventeen days later.  The mail is playing tricks on us.

How are you, my darling wife?  Are you still tired and weary?  Do the noisy working hours irritate you?  Do not worry about me, darling.  Take life easy.  I’ll be home someday.  I do not know when, but I know that I will come back to you.  See that you take good care of yourself because you are the person that I care for more than anyone else in the whole world.

I am feeling as usual.  I am all set here.  We have built showers, latrines, kitchens, and dining rooms and have dug a well.  It was all under my supervision and everything came out all right.  Now I am all set to enjoy the hard work and take it easy.  Everything is quiet and peaceful.  It is not too warm and I feel comfortable, but I would prefer to endure the cold weather and be with you.

My darling Annette,

I received today the letters you wrote me on February 9 and 11.  I am sorry you did not receive any letters from me during our first anniversary.  Do you remember a year ago today?  We were happily riding through the southern states, unconscious that within a few weeks, we would be separated by a big ocean and for such a long time.  

I tried to change my fountain pen, but it did not work.  Did I tell you that I lost my fountain pen?  It has been my greatest misfortune since I landed in New Guinea.

I have been here now for some time.  You know how long from my letters.  I hope you have received by this time the first letters I wrote you from this island.  I tried to use the air mail stamps you sent me, but the dampness of the air has been too high for a while and they are all spoiled.  

You ask me how I am.  I am feeling well, darling, and I love my wife deeply.  Life here is running on like any other place I have been so far.  When I arrived here, the place was new, untouched by white men or natives.  With time and work, we have made a nice place to live in.  I say nice, but do not think that it can compare with home.  But, it could be worse.  Out of cans, we dug and built a well, built a shower, etc.  As you know, I am doing my usual work.  There is no entertainment here with the exception of a movie once in a great while.  The projector broke and we must wait for another one from Australia.

I have not played golf for at least three months.  Here, life goes on in the usual way.  I sleep in a tent with the Chaplain, who is a Lutheran and a very nice fellow, and two other medical officers.  They are my assistants.  One is from New York and the other is from North Dakota.  They are all a very congenial group and we really can have some fun just talking. 

 It is funny that the jungle is never at peace.  Ants are crawling around, mosquitoes are flying around, and a million different insects sing or make noise day and night.  The birds wake me up every morning with their singing.  Some songs are fair, others are too raw to be pleasing to the ear.  There is one, for instance, that cries “Help! Help!” at the top of its rasping voice.  There is another one that says, “How do you do?” in a low, soft voice.   

Last Saturday, I went to a dance.  I was told that there was a dance in the nearby native village.  I went with the idea of seeing men and women natives dancing.  I was surprised when I saw a native from his middle thighs up all covered by a thick coat of leaves that he shook repeatedly during the dance.  Covering the leaves was a conical tube covered by bird feathers.  A group of natives sang and beat their wooden instruments.  The native songs and the dancing were rhythmical and full of drama.  The natives are really wonderful.  They do all the heavy work and like us.  When I meet them, they greet me with a “Good Day.”  Some of them are Catholic and wear medals. 

Darling, until the next time!


									I am all yours,


									Silvio

Do you remember where we were a year ago today?  Was it Texas or New Mexico?  What a happy time!  Look at me now.  Here I am, far away, living in the jungle like a native!

Life is running its usual course.  I sleep eight hours a day, work a few hours.  I take it easy during the rest of the time.  The food is good, though monotonous.  

I am reading “The Mediterranean” by Emil Ludwig.  Last night, I went to the movies and saw an old picture, “In Name Only.”  I kind of like it.  

I lost my fountain pen.  Here I add an official request.   With it you can send me a package.

My darling Annette,

I received from you today your letter of January 15, 1943.  I enjoyed it, but I was disappointed because I would like to hear and read what was your reaction to my promotion.  I know that you wanted it as badly as I did.  Since I became Battalion Surgeon, I have had the best time since I came to Australia.  I like responsibility and the feeling of accomplishing something.  

My life is the usual routine.  I get up with the sun and eat my breakfast.  I like to mix bread with canned pears, sugar, condensed milk, and milk.  It’s my new combination and I like it.  After breakfast, my professional work and inspection of the kitchen takes the good part of the morning.  We have lunch, then some work to do or reading.  After supper, we have a motion picture.  The nights are cool and I sleep very well with a blanket. 

This morning, I woke early.  It being dark, I did not like to get up.  My mind wandered to a year ago when we were in Arizona.  Do you remember?  What happy days!  When will they come back again?  It will never be soon enough for me.   

Here we have an eternal spring, summer, and fall at the same time.  Some trees are in bloom, some have ripe fruits, some are discarding yellow leaves.  All is done at the same time.  Insects are plentiful and annoying.  I cannot call myself all yours anymore because the mosquitoes, ants, and other insects treat me as if I were their playground.  I take good care of myself, however, and I destroy them every time I have a chance.  Other insects are buzzing day and night.  Last night, a heavy rain fell.  The drops were pattering on my tent.  Do you remember?  The rain...  A cricket was playing his instrument under my cot.  It was busy all night.  It’s wonderful how tireless these insects are.

Yesterday, I saw a funny sight.  A native woman was sitting on the ground while her husband was climbing a coconut tree.  She had a child of about a year old nursing from her sagging breast and a cigarette in her mouth.  Her hair was cut short, nearly as short as mine, while her husband had long, curly hair decorated with red flowers.  His ears were pierced and he wore colored beads similar to those worn around the neck by children in poor countries in Europe.  I would like to send you some souvenirs from the natives.  However, I do not like to send them to you, nor to touch them.  These natives are infected by various skin diseases that are transmitted through objects.  I keep a certain distance from them.  I never examine them without wearing rubber gloves.

How are your mother, aunt, and uncle?  Did you hear from your cousin?
I cannot tell you how much I miss you and how much I yearn to come home.  I’ll be there someday.  I hope it will not be long. I love you and adore you.
										I am yours,
										Silvio

										March 19, 1943

My darling Annette,

Today I met a lucky man who was in New England only two months ago.  I asked him how New England life was.  He did not tell me anything new that I hadn’t read in your letters.  

Here, as you have already seen, I have a stencil sketch of the life of a native woman.  It gives you an idea of the background:  coconut trees, the straw cabin that is a couple of feet elevated from the ground, and how the native women are dressed and how they carry their food supplies.  In addition to carrying their goods on the top of their heads, they carry them in a fishnet bag on their backs.

How are you, my beloved Annette?  I have not heard from you since February 17.  I do not know how you received the news of my new residence, though you had a feeling that I was in these surroundings.  I am eagerly waiting to hear what your reaction was to my promotion.  I wrote to you a few minutes after I received it.  I could not, nor can I, send you a telegram.  There does not exist such a modern luxury in this part of the world for private use.

Darling, I am feeling very well.  Lately, I ate fresh meat and even bread.  Both are a luxury around here.  We celebrate every time we see bread or meat.  The food as a whole has been good and sufficient.  I have not lost any weight.  

I hope by now that the cold weather is a thing of the past.  29 degrees below zero!    That’s really cold and how!

Do you know that during the past nineteen days I went back and relived the same days we passed a year ago?  I relived all the happy times we had and all our arguments that always ended happily.  

Do you know what I did yesterday?  I built a rat trap.  A couple of rats, maybe more, are roaming around my tent every night.  Some even dare to come and crawl in my cot.  They have been respectful so far.  But, I do not care for their company nor for their respect.  I am going to keep them at a certain distance and, if possible, in the rat trap.  I’ll let you know how successful I am as a rat trap builder.  Last night, due to a stormy and rainy night, I had no success.  I am waiting for them tonight. 

Another way to kill the time is by reading.  I read a few books recently: “The Mediterranean” by Ludwig, “The American Ideal,” “Inside Italy,” and a book of tropical diseases, etc.   Another pastime is playing cards.  I like cribbage.  Olson and I play a few games every day.  Today I won and so it was yesterday, but I lost the previous day.  I like it and it makes me feel as if I were back to the happy era of 1937-1938.  Do you remember the time we played together?   Last night, I played 500 for the first time.  Samuel and I were partners against the Chaplain and Olson who are both seasoned players.  Samuel and I are completely green.  We learned the game and won it.  I know it is beginner’s luck.  But we won.  

As you see, darling, life is not so bad.  Today, two officers who specialize in preventing tropical diseases came to see my area.  I told them to take a notebook and a pencil to take notes about how an area should be kept.  When they left, they congratulated me and told me nothing could be better.

I have not studied any phonetics lately.  I intend to start again soon.

Darling, I love and adore you.


									I am all yours,


									Silvio

P.S. I include a Captain’s bar made out of a piece of a Zero plane that was destroyed in New Guinea.  I made the bars myself.  If you like, you can have a jeweler put a pin on for a few cents and wear it.  I hope you like this souvenir.  The bars are attached to the envelope by adhesive tape.

My darling Annette,

It’s Sunday afternoon.  I am on duty at the Aid Station.  It was a quiet day.  It rained the first half of the morning, not heavily as usual, but in the fashion of a rainy day in New England in the fall.

I have been reading all day.  I finished the book “Pattern of Conquest” and started a new one about an hour ago.  Reading books is my best pastime.  Now, it’s a calm afternoon.  The sky is cloudy.  A pale sun is going down in the West.  A band is playing about half a mile away and music comes to me with the breeze.  

I received your letter of February 24.  By then you knew I was in New Guinea.  Honestly speaking, I do not find any difference between Australia and New Guinea with the exception that I do not have a chance to play golf in this part of the world.

I was flattered yesterday when a native passed by my tent.  He stopped at the doorstep to say, “Hello” and look in.  On my table that I built with my own hands from trees that I cut down there is you picture.  He saw it and had a big smile on his face.  He made me understand that you are very beautiful.  A husband is always flattered to hear that his wife is charming, even if it comes from a native who has not been sophisticated by movies or modern life.  I gave him a couple of cigarettes that I took from Olson. 

Darling, today is the first day of spring.  From now on, you won’t have any more severe winter cold of any long duration.  Here it is spring, summer, and fall every day, but no winter cold at all.  

I am feeling fine and enjoy an excellent appetite.  Yesterday, I met a man who was in New England less than two months ago.  The lucky ...

I love you very much.


										I am all yours.

										March 22, 1943

My darling Annette.

At dinner time today, we all remembered that eleven months ago we sailed for Australia.  Eleven long months have passed!   I never knew that I could be able to live and stay away from you for so long.  Eleven months is a short period in the life of a man, but it’s as long as eternity for me since I madly love my wife.  How long will they keep us apart?  I hope that the authorities will realize soon that a soldier can be very good for some time.  After a few months, at the most a year, he will madly yearn for the things he left at home, for the sweetness of life, for the company of an understanding and gentle being, for love and what love stands for.  I start to realize that a soldier will be no good to his country if he is kept away too long from his own dear ones.  It becomes an obsession for us and me, the desire to go home to my wife, even if it is only for a short while.  How long will I remain in these foreign islands?   

It is a grand day here.  The climate is wonderful.  The sky is of a deep blue.  The sun is warm.  It is peaceful all around.  The insects, oh the insects are really a headache.  They creep all over.  They bite and they sing or chatter all day and night.  

Now that it is Lent, the Chaplain is giving up smoking.  I do not have anything to give up, so I think that for Lent I’ll give up not smoking.  This made the Chaplain laugh at me.  We have some fun in our tent.  We talk and argue about everything and never conclude anything.  We are very good at starting rumors.  All our rumors are about the time that we will leave New Guinea for the old United States of America.  You should see how quickly the rumors spread!  I started one at noon one day and I got it back six hours afterwards!

The rat trap is good, but the rats are smarter.  They play around it, but never fall into the trap.  One did fall in, but succeeded in escaping.  I guess he told his gang about the trap.  They all seem to know now and keep away from it.  I must get a different one because I don’t think I can stand to be laughed at and least of all by a rat.  

I am sorry to close now.  I am going to read “The Blind Man’s House” by Hugh Walpole.

I love you as immensely as the Pacific Ocean. 

										All yours,

										Silvio

My darling wife,

It’s March 29 again.  Do you remember the date?  It is the day they kidnapped us from Shelton where we were so happy.  During the last week, I have been reliving the happy spring days we enjoyed in the little and hospitable town of Shelton.  It was a grand time.  I don’t remember ever having been happier.  I would not like to relive the few days that followed March 29.  Was I miserable!  I walked and moved around for days in a haze.  Do you remember how upset we were?  Someday we will look back on those days with a smile on our lips.  This war will come to an end someday and we will be back together.  And no power in the world will separate us again.  We have to make up for all the time we lost.  

I have been working on a ring for an entire day.  I wanted to make you a ring out of a piece of a propeller of a Zero plane that was downed by our pilots.  It was my first experience.  I made it too big.  It came out too large.  It just fits my second finger.  I am going to try it again the next chance I have, I hope with better luck. 

My folks have celebrated the fortieth anniversary of their marriage.  I do not think it was a happy one with their children on three continents.  

Lieutenant Ail is here.  Do you remember him?  He was sleeping in the room in the front of mine at Fort Lewis.  He sends you his best regards.  He came to the station for some help.  The chiggers are giving him trouble.  Have you ever heard of the chiggers?  They are small insects, very small, that penetrate the skin and cause severe itching, pain, redness and swelling.  I cannot find a way to prevent them.  I can cure them and lessen any pain.  

Next month, I plan to send you some money that I saved.  I do not have a chance to spend a penny here.  The natives are satisfied with a couple of cigarettes for any work they are called to do.

Last week, I went to Mass in the evening.  The Chaplain goes around and celebrates Mass any hour of the day.  Yesterday, I went to hear Mass by the ocean.  They took motion pictures of the service.  It is going to be shown in the States.  You may see me in the second row.  

I do not know yet what reaction you had to my Captaincy.  Here I have been a Captain       for more than two months and you still keep on asking me when I am going to get it.  

The weather is good.  I heard a rumor today that we are going to go back to the United States sometime during the present year.  Too bad it is only a rumor!  Oh!  How I wish that it was a fact!  I miss you every day, more and more.  How happy I would be to be back together.  I do not mind in which part of the States.  To be with you anywhere and anyplace would be and is all that I want, yearn and eagerly long for.  One day we will be together again.  Oh!  How I love you!

My beloved Annette, until the next letter.  I adore you.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio


HAPPY EASTER!

My darling Annette,

I have received your v-mail letters of March 12 and 18.  It gave me a thrill to see my name preceded by my new title.  I wanted badly to know your reaction, but you do not mention anything about it.  It is only in the address.  I know you wrote me an air mail letter.  It will come later.  The air mail letters take from 6 weeks to 8 weeks to come here.  The v-mail letters are much faster.  They reach me in 3 weeks or a few days longer, or less.

I have not written to you for a few days.  I have been in the jungle for a few days a few miles from here.  Nothing exciting happened.  Only the frogs kept me from falling asleep at my usual time of 8 P.M. This time corresponds to 6 o’clock in the morning at home.  I do not get up until 6 A.M. or 20 minutes later.  As you see or can deduce, I get plenty of sleep, 10 hours a day.  

I pass my days reading.  I have read more books in New Guinea than I did in Australia.  I have finished reading a book by D. Thompson.  I started to read “Nana” by Zola.  I read 25 pages and stopped.  I do not like it.  It disgusted me.  Now I am reading “the Best Plays of 1941-1942.”  I am enjoying these plays.

I started to practice my phonetics.  I dedicate a few minutes or hours daily to it.  It all depends on how I feel.

My work is going on as usual.  I am satisfied with it.  I am feeling very well and I would not mind being in New Guinea if it were not for the simple, unpleasant fact that I am so far away from you.  Last night, I awoke with the sweetness of your kisses on my lips.  It was so real and I love it so much that I hated myself for having stopped dreaming.  Someday it will come true.  I do not know when, but I know it will.  

Recently, we had some entertainment, a movie “The Boys from Syracuse.”  I saw Joe Brown the comedian.  He gave us an hour’s entertainment.  Does he have a big mouth!  He calls it his kisser.  He did not have to talk.  The faces he makes are enough to make everybody laugh.

Today, we had a two-hour show given by the Aussie soldiers.  It was funny.  It made us forget the war for a while anyhow.

Last night, we had a rain storm.  The rain came down so thick that you cannot imagine it unless you see it.  It rained most of the night.  Now the sky is a beautiful deep blue.

How are you?  How are your mother and aunt and uncle?  How are you coming along with your work?  Are you getting used to it?  You have been working for more than four months already.  I often wonder during the day what you are doing up there and always yearn and wish that I could be with you.  I miss you an awful lot and love you very, very much.


										I am all yours,


										Silvio


P.S.	Today it’s fourteen months since our marriage.  Soon it will be a year since we saw each other.  How much longer?

										Silvio

My darling and beloved Annette,

Yesterday, I remembered that a year ago, we were at Mt. Rainier and had a grand time.  I have the pictures we took in my own pocket.  I did not have to take them out and look at them because the memory was too fresh in my mind. 

 Darling, I have received your air mail letters of March 6 and 8 and a day before your v-mail letter of March 22.  The mail system has been treating me very well lately.   I can’t complain.  

Do you remember some time ago I wrote you about a ring that I was going to make for you out of an airplane propeller?  I do not mean from the whole propeller, but from a chunk of it.  Here it is.  I include it in this letter.  I sawed it out of the propeller of a Zero plane downed in New Guinea during the campaign.  This is my second attempt.  The first one did not come out so well.  The ring would have fit your big toe!  It’s good enough for my middle finger.  I cannot tell you how long I sweated to file this ring.  I was so immersed in my work that I did not feel my hands hurt until I was through.  Then, I found that I had a couple of blisters.  It was a real pleasure that I had in working on it.  I thought of you and imagined that you would proudly wear it.  Its intrinsic value is not great, but its history is great and of the moment.  Very few ladies in the States will be able to wear a ring made out of a Zero by their own husband.  All the men and officers who saw it liked it and some are going to try to make one.  It is not a band ring.  It has a rim too thick for that.  It’s a simple ring.  You will excuse me for bragging so much about the ring, will you?  I am kind of proud of it.  It took me long hours of filing and rubbing with sandpaper and tooth powder and a soft cloth.  In the inside rim, it is written or engraved S (Silvio) to A(Annette) with love-1943-N.G.(New Guinea).  The engraving is not my work.  The words are mine and right from my heart.  An Australian man engraved it for me for a few shillings.  He had the tools to do it.  The Chaplain thinks the inscription is romantic and plans or would like to make a similar one for his wife.

Oh, you do not know, darling, how much I would like to come back to you and home!  That is what I am hoping and wishing and thinking about twenty-four hours a day.  This statement is not an exaggeration because I dream of it during my sleep.  The other night, I received an immensely sweet kiss from you in my dream.  The sweetness of it is still lasting.

Here life is running as usual.  It would be all right except for the chiggers.  They have been bothering me for the past two days.  I have a cure for them.

My beloved wife, until the next letter, I am all yours body and soul.

										April 18, 1943

My darling Annette,

A year ago today, in the early morning, I bid you goodbye.  Do you remember?  I waved to you from the moving car.  You were standing by the window.  I could see tears in your eyes.  A whole year has gone by.  And look where I am now!  In the New Guinea jungle, so far away from you.  I am asking myself, “How long will they keep me away from my beloved wife?”  A year is a long time, too long.  I do wish that it was the first and last one.  On April 21, it will be a whole year since I kissed you.  I have relived those last weeks, the whole ten.  From April 21 on, I do not like to remember them.  I’ll go back to other memories of the preceding years when we were very happy too. 

As I told you before, I receive your v-mail letters within 18-21 days.  It takes 6 weeks for the air mail letters to reach me.  You may as well send them by the usual mail.  They take the same time.  

Today it’s another Sunday, but here there is no difference.  All days are the same.  I am taking care of the men as usual and with the best of my abilities.  It’s a great feeling to know that when I save a man from certain death, I’ll make somebody in the States that I never saw and never will see very happy.  It’s a feeling that no money can buy.  It partially compensates for the hardship and discomfort a doctor goes through.  I am glad and willing to do my part.  I hope they will consider it and give me a break so that I can go home soon and be with the best lady in the whole world, my beloved wife.  

I love you and adore you.

									I am all yours,
									Silvio

P.S.	I am feeling fine.  I may as well start to wish you a HAPPY BIRTHDAY!   S.

I have some more to say.

A week ago, I sent you an air mail letter that included a ring that I made out of a Zero propeller.  My blisters are all healed now and I am able to use my hands again.

Yesterday, I did my sewing.  My pants are badly worn in a couple of places.  I cut a piece out of the tails of the shirt and patched them.  They are usable now and today I am wearing them.  They will last for a few weeks longer.  Then I hope I’ll get some new ones.

I had no luck with my rat trap.  The rats are too smart.  I am going to prepare some poison.  That will do it!

This week I have been busy and had no time for reading.  I have a feeling now that I have done good work.  The weather is good.  It’s nice and cool at night.  I sleep well.  

Did I tell you that I have been smoking during the last week?  It’s a good way to keep the mosquitoes away.  I do not think that I will get into the habit.  I intend to cut it out as soon as I leave this malaria-infested island.  Do not worry about me getting malaria.  I am taking all possible precautions to prevent it.  The other units consider the area under my control a park.  They call it ____Park.  I cannot mention the name of the Colonel commanding my unit.

I am going to take a shower now and then go to supper.

Until next time, have all my love.

My darling and beloved wife,

I have received this morning the letter you wrote on March 16.

I am sorry that you had to suffer from diarrhea.  I wish I were home to take care of you.  I could have cured you in a couple of days.  I have great experience with that ailment.  I had cured not tens but hundreds of men.  But now I am sure that you are all right and have forgotten it.  I guess that you ate something that irritated your bowels.  You should have taken a good physic.

Darling, do not worry about me.  I am feeling tops.  I have not even had a cold for a year.  As far as malaria is concerned, I cannot afford to get it because I have to take care of those who are suffering from it.  Don’t worry, darling, I am taking very good care of myself.  It is not as bad as people write and talk about in this place.  To tell you the truth, I prefer it to Australia.  I have had more time to myself and did plenty of reading.  My work has been satisfactory and gave me happy moments.  There is that feeling of doing something helpful for my fellow man that makes my life away from you bearable.  Everything is quiet here.

I write you often, at least once a week.  I don’t see any use in writing more often because I know that the mail will reach you in spurts and all in a bunch.  Some fellows are writing every day or every other day.  I know their letters by heart.  They keep on repeating the same thing day after day.  I really pity the censor that has to read them and the receiver.

Recently, I sent you a ring that I made with my own hands from a chunk of an airplane propeller.  I hope that you have received it.  I liked it so much that I want you to have it.  

A year ago at this time (don’t forget that I am eighteen hours ahead of San Francisco), we were together eating supper and drinking.  Do you remember the champagne?  Do you remember that private booth?  Yes, today, it’s the last day I do remember of our honeymoon.  I am anxious to pick up where we left off.  I do wish that they would send me back home.  Even for a little while, it would be satisfying for me.  Oh, if I could come home, I think I would not wait for one more minute.  I am hoping that someday I’ll be able to hold you in my arms and kid and laugh and play and have a good time again and love you.  We must make up for all the time we lost.  We will make up, won’t we?

I adore and love you.  Remember me to your people.


									I am all yours,
									Silvio

										April 26, 1943

My darling Annette,

I have just received the v-mail letter you wrote on April 8.  It took only 18 days!  This is the shortest time one of your letters took to cross the ocean.  I have also received the air mail letter you sent me during the middle of March.  The mail service has been treating me very well lately.  I hope you will say the same in your letters.

How did you pass Easter Sunday?  Did you wear a new hat?  And your new coat?  I wish I could have seen you.  We were together last Easter.  I hope that we will be able to celebrate the next one together.    It was a glorious day here.  The sky was cloudless and of a deep, beautiful blue.  The temperature war warm, but not excessively, more similar to a June rather than a warm July day.  We had church services in the morning.  The band played a few musical numbers very well.  

I have studied phonetics most of the day.  I’m going to learn to speak good English before I come back home.  However, I would be more than willing to come back now as I am.

I am still trying to find a device to catch the rats.  So far, I have had no success.  It is hard to say, but I must admit, the rats are victorious and have the floor of my tent and whatever is in it at their disposition during the quiet hours of the night.  I am not going to give it up, however.  

These d_____ chiggers are bothering me.  They cause a strong and painful itching at the lower extremities.  I know how to handle them, but not before they have won the first round.  

How are you?  I am feeling grand.  No complaints.  Today I walked through the jungle.  The word “walk” is not appropriate in this case because it means that I crawled, stomped, jumped, and burrowed my way through thorns.  I crossed a field of grass that is from six to seven feet high.  Cogon grass!  And I tell you, it is really tiresome to walk through it.

I am sorry to disappoint you, but I don’t know anything about the time when I’ll come home.  It’s up in the minds of the gods.  How long I’ll be in this island I also do not know.    I don’t mind it.  I may as well be here than in any other place when the other place is out of the States where I cannot meet you.

I love you, darling.  Thinking of you and adoring you.

										I am all yours,

										Silvio

								Somewhere in New Guinea
								April 27, 1943

My darling wife,

I have received simultaneously your letter of April 2nd, the box or package containing the fountain pen I am using, and a telegram.  I do not know when the telegram was dispatched.  I read the telegram first.  I opened it with a feeling of suspension and anxiety.  I was afraid that something had happened to you.  I was suddenly relieved when I read it.  

Now I am worried because you do worry too much about me.  Darling, I am feeling fine.  I am only disappointed that I am unable to catch a rat.  They eat the bait and leave me a souvenir or two!  I do not like to mention what they are.  

My work is keeping me fairly busy.  I do not have to tell you that I am pleased with my work.  I am helping my fellow man and feel that I am accomplishing something that is noble and human.  I feel that I am doing my part in this titanic struggle for world power and a happier future civilization.

We have a victory garden.  One of my men is a good farmer and is in charge of the sowing and care taking of the different herbs we sowed.  You should see how rapidly they grow!   The well is giving us plenty of water that we use for showers and washing.  My men and I take a shower daily.  They wash their clothing once a week and boil their clothes.  I have a man taking care of my washing and of my sleeping quarters.  He is not as good as you are.  Far from it.  He is a good fellow, but he does not have the feminine touch so particular to my wife who I love so much.

The nights are wonderful and the days are pleasant and warm enough not to make me uncomfortable.  I really do not mind staying here.  I prefer this place to where I lived in Australia. 

Do not mention again that your writing is bothering me.  It is everything for me.  I am only disappointed when I reach the end of your letter.  I am glad and happy to hear what is going on at home and what you are going through.  I love to hear everything about you.

Here, everything is nice and quiet.  I am feeling wonderful and I am in such a condition as to be able to meet any situation successfully.  If I were not in excellent health, I would not be here.  We do not keep any weaklings here, nor men with the mentality of the pre-Pearl Harbor period.  In this island, all men are heroes.  I am daily becoming proud to be with such a group of brave men who can take it as brave men do.  These men are not second to any of the heroes of our past history.  

I do hope that sometime I’ll be able to come home to you. 

Last night, I saw the movie “Love Affair” starring Charles Boyer.  I like the song that starts with “Wishing...”  I have been humming it all day. 

You know what I wish?  To be able to see you in the near future.  In the meantime, I’ll keep wishing and hoping that one day my wish will come true. 


									I love you,


									Silvio


P.S.	Thank you for the fountain pen.  I like it very much.  It is writing beautifully and smoothly.  Thank you again.

									Love,

									Silvio
