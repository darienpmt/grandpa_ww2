My beloved wife,

After I stopped writing to you last night or last year to make it sound different, I went around the area, visited a few tents, then went to bed.  I put on a clean pair of pajamas so as to start the new year in clean linen.  I could not sleep though I felt drowsy.  The lights were on.  Olson was writing to his wife and an officer came to pay us a visit.  I talked and took a nap between words.  I do not recollect clearly what I talked about, probably the usual nonsense dictated by the season and circumstances.  He left about a quarter of an hour before midnight.  I fell asleep.

At midnight, all hell broke loose.  A siren screamed, machine guns and rifles crackled, and the ship sirens made their raucous sound.  It reminded me of New York harbor during a foggy day.  Some men had prepared a few dynamite charges and had them blown up.  They sounded as if a thousand pound bomb had just exploded.  I could not sleep.  Another visitor came in wishing me a Happy New Year.  I turned and twisted when he left and prepared myself for a good sleep.  In the meantime, I had exchanged good wishes with Olson and officers in tents within hearing.  I had become unconscious or sliding into the stupor that precedes good sound sleep when I got called again.

This time, a man was wounded accidentally.  I got up, cursing people and their thoughtlessness.  The man had nothing to do with it.  He was looking at the sky when a bullet hit his right arm.  I took care of him.  More than that, I removed the bullet from his arm.  I started my new year by working.  I have the bullet in my pocket.  I’ll keep it as a souvenir.

Satisfied to have done a good job, I went back to bed and slept until seven o’clock.  I got up from bed, washed, bathed and shaved, had a good breakfast and had a good talk.

Here I’m writing to you.  I wish you the best year you ever had.  I wish you all the happiness this world can give to a human being.  I wish for you that all your wishes, desires, and aspirations become realities.

For myself, I hope that my only aspiration, my only desire, my only yearning becomes a reality.  I hope that I’ll be able to see the day and live the moment when finally I’ll have you in my arms. 

I love you, darling.  I love you very much.  I love you with all my heart and I want to be with you.  I want to be happy with you.

Happy New Year!  I love you.
											Silvio

My darling Annette,

A few moments ago, I received your two letters of December 19 and 23.  I had dreamed, also, to be home during those days preceding the holidays.  I had imagined all the things we would do together and all the things we would talk about, but here I am still far away.  I’m still living on the same hill under cover of the same tent.  My life is running as usual.

I have been reading “Wickford Point” by John P. Marquand.  It’s a novel about contemporary New England and most of the story develops in or around Boston.  I like to read it because I like to remember the places we were together.  It keeps my mind wandering in the sweet and pleasant past.  I like to remember the New England snowstorms and the snow piled on the side of the roads and the freezing, cold wind and you and me huddled together to keep warm.

I was worried about the furnace.  I have not found any mention of its misbehavior in your last two letters.  I conclude that your house is warm and that the furnace is doing its part in the war effort.

I’m gradually eating the candy you sent me.  Some of the packages have only been opened by curiosity.  You know that men are nothing but grown-up children.  The curiosity, the uncertainty, the feeling of expectancy is alluring and irresistible.  I’ll keep nibbling at them and remembering my thoughtful wife.

You sure are a wonderful wife.  You have saved a good amount of money.  We will save it for our rainy days and spend it “together.”  We have to enjoy every cent of it.  We have sacrificed so much to accumulate it.  It is the fruit of our dark cloud that will magically upon my arrival home change into a silver lining.  Don’t you agree with me?

I have been trying my utmost to get a trip home.  I’m waiting and hoping.  How long can I keep on hoping?

Have my best kiss.  I love you.

											I’m yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

It has rained for the most part of the day.  It has been cool.  It has been ideal weather for reading or resting or talking.

Outside, the weather was ideal for ducks.  The ducks had a grand day.  Did I tell you that now we have six ducks?  One of the men, who went on furlough to Australia, came back with six baby ducks as mascots.  He carried them in a shoe box.  He had many long stops on the way back.  Meanwhile, the ducks kept growing in size and became crowded, noisy, and troublesome.  He had his hands full, but stuck to it.  They too are becoming the mascots of our unit.  They are funny birds and they make me laugh.  They pay a routine visit to every kitchen and are not particular about food.  They eat everything.

How are you, darling?  I’m feeling as usual.  I had a good breakfast this morning.  Fresh eggs!  What a meal!  They were delicious.  Lately, I are some fruit and vegetables.  I even had fresh cherries!

Is it cold at home?  Is the furnace behaving?  

I’m reading “Life With Father.”  It makes me laugh and chuckle.  I recommend it to you.  It’s easy reading and relaxing.  It’s a good pastime.

It’s midmorning.  Last night, I stopped writing.  A mosquito was giving me trouble.  It was buzzing around my ears persistently and annoyingly.  I got after it.  Then Olson came into my tent and we started to talk.  We discussed the war and our chances of getting home this spring.  Rotation is our pet subject.  We always talk about it.

Last night, it rained heavily.  The wind blew strongly and scattered some of my light books and newspapers all around the area.

I like the dried fruit you sent me.  I ate some of it after each meal.  They are exquisite.

There is nothing new at present.   Reading continues to be my best pastime.

I love you with all my heart.

										I am yours,

My darling Annette,

Your letter of December 26 surprises me and leaves me a little stunned.  Please, darling, do not think for a second that I intentionally wanted to hurt you.  Far from it.  Don’t you think that we misunderstood each other?  I had intended to send you that shell bracelet as a Christmas gift.  It was the only thing I could send you from this island.  It was one of the best bracelets ever made by an American soldier on this island.  This is not only my opinion, but that of many other men.  It reached you too soon.

In one of the letters you wrote me in November, you told me that you bought a new winter coat and that you were going to consider it as a Christmas gift from me to you.  Do you remember, darling?  When I read it, I was glad.  It had solved my problem for Christmas.  I was thankful and felt lucky.  I know that you like Christmas and all its trimmings like the exchange of gifts and good wishes.  My conscience was tranquil regarding gifts, so I stressed good wishes and kept writing you daily.

This was the first holidays I celebrated in peace and at ease and in comfort.  I wrote to you very often.  I wanted you to receive news from me during the holidays.  From what you write me, I feel I got what I wanted.

Now, as for the flowers.  I do not have facilities on these islands to manage to send you flowers.  I had sent you all the money I had.  I know that you could buy them if you so desired.  Moreover, you never gave me even a hint that you cherished flowers.  I know you like them, but I never thought that you were extremely fond of them.  

I’m sorry but I cannot send you the Silver Star.  I don’t have it.  I guess we don’t have them in this area.  So far, none of the men received them.  I do not know the reason why.  I don’t care.  I have the official announcement and that is what really counts.  Everybody can buy one.  Do not worry, darling.  I’ll receive it someday and I promise that I’ll send it to you on the same day.

I could have sent you that money order as a Christmas gift.  I thought it was more romantic to send it as the beginning of a fund for our honeymoon.  Thinking that I had satisfied my conscience with the coat, I turned my thoughts to the good times we will have together.  That day, I was very optimistic.  You know how life is.  Some days everything looks bright and promising.  The world seems to be made for my happiness.  Some other days, all goes wrong and everybody and everything seems to try the utmost to make my life miserable.

A month from today, we will be married three years.  I don’t know where I’ll be that day.  I don’t know if I’ll be lucky enough to be sent home.  Nobody knows until a few hours before leaving for home.   But wherever I’ll be physically, mentally I’ll be with you, wishing I could kiss, hug, and love you, be with you and tell you, whispering in your ears, that I do love you with all my heart, that you made me the happiest man in the world when you married me and that to be married to you makes me very happy.  I wish I could tell you “viva voce” that I married you, the girl who was my ideal of “girlhood” and my ideal of a woman.  

I don’t know what to send you for our anniversary.  I do not have a thing.  So will you please buy something you like for me and keep it as a gift from me?  I hope our misunderstanding is settled and dispelled.

Until next time, have all my love.

											I am yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I am writing from my tent perched on top of the hill, surrounded by luxurious vegetation.  I am sitting in the same place I have been for more than six months.

I repeat this because I don’t want you to worry about me.  Today, you heard of the last American landings.  You know now that they landed in Luzon.  Do not worry, darling.  I am not in it.  I am still on the same island.

Yesterday, I received the letter you wrote and mailed on New Year’s Eve.  It’s really good mail service.

Today, I have been moving around the island and tonight I’m a little bit tired.

I liked your last letter.  It is cheerful.  I am glad not to find a mention of your hurt feelings.  I knew it would not last long.  It’s one of your traits that I like very much.

I have to close for tonight.  I only have time to say “Good Night” before the lights go out.

I love you with all my heart.


										I am yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

How are you, my darling wife?  Are you remembering our quick exchange of letters between Lowell and Carlisle three long years ago?  Those were the days!  I used to rush home, anxious to read your letters.  I was tired when I left the school room after eight long hours of lectures, but your letters refreshed my mind and I was ready to answer you.  I was counting the days then, as I am counting the weeks now.  Then, I knew I was going to be with you on our appointed day.  Now, I do not establish the day.  Somebody else does, darn it!

I had to interrupt my writing yesterday afternoon because it started to rain, then to pour.
It rained so heavily that the tent developed a few leaks.  A few scattered drops were falling on my desk.  I stopped writing and looked at the rain.  It fascinates me to see a heavy rainstorm.  It stirs me to hear it tick tock on my tent.  It stirs my memories.

After supper, I listened to the news from Australia which was heartening.  We are winning again all around the globe.  It is a change for the best since the gloomy days of Leyte and the unexpected, traumatic breakthrough in Belgium.  The Philippine news is really heartening.  I pray that it keeps on until victory.

I saw “In Society” with Abbott and Costello.  I was annoyed.  Their childish pranks do not excite laughter.  They have played the same tricks so long that they are becoming unbearable.  We were lucky yesterday.  It rained all day and it rained all night, but the sky was clear and full of stars during the show.  The weather is our friend.

Did I have a good breakfast this morning!  And how!  Three eggs that were fried to my taste, buttered toast, Vienna sausage and coffee with cream.  We had good meals during the last few days. 

I’m glad you are receiving my mail regularly.  It helps to keep the home front and the frontline morale up.  I have already written you that I have not received the medal yet.  I don’t think that there are any in this area.  It will come someday and I’ll send it to you the day I get it.

I include a ten gulden Japanese bill used by the invaders in the Dutch East Indies.

Have millions and millions of kisses.

										I love you.

My darling Annette,

I fully agree with you that the mail is doing a very good job.  It was a really fast trip for my Christmas letters to reach you in ten days.  Yesterday, I got your letter of January 6.

Today, it’s exactly three weeks to our third anniversary and from all appearances, I’ll still be here on February 7.  Instead of shivering from cold weather, I’ll be here, stifling from the tropical heat.  Recently, it has been very warm.  The sun has been burning more than usual.  Thank goodness, this noon we had a good half-hour shower.  It kept me cool while it lasted.  

The day before yesterday, I went out for a morning walk of a couple of hours.  I did not volunteer.  I had to go.  I’m getting too fat and need some exercise.  I have not done much lately.  I took it really easy.  I was out again today since early morning.  I moved from my tent to the field and back.  I have not done much work but run and walk around.  I feel tired tonight.  I’m sure I’ll have a deep night’s sleep.

I’ll have to come home and take care of your headaches and your coccyx.  Have you tried to sit on a rubber seat?  It would be comfortable and relieve some of the weights.

No, darling, I have not taken part in any landings for a long time.  Your worries have been uncalled for.  This is part of Army life.  You have to suffer because I’m in the Army.  I am still here, darling, in the same place on the same island.

Tomorrow, I’ll receive a new issue of beer.  I’ll have all the drinks to your health.  I like a glass of beer during the hottest part of the day.

Do you know that within four days I’ll start my thirty-fourth month since I kissed you the last time in the San Francisco dockyard?  Thirty-four months!  An eternity!

However, I have hopes.  I hope that when the cold New England weather will turn to a soft, flowery, warm spring, I’ll be with you to enjoy it.  I’d love to be with you in the spring.  It will be the best part of the year to start life anew with Mother Nature.  It will bring warmth to our hearts and happiness to our minds.  I’m eagerly looking forward to it.

I love you so much that I keep on dreaming time and again of our reunion.

I love you.

											I’m all yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I intended to write you last evening after the movies during the quiet and coolness of the early night.  But I had a treat.  They showed a double feature and many shorts.  By the time it was through, it was nearly midnight and cool.  It was exceptionally cool last night.  I needed a sheet and a blanket instead of the usual sheet or blanket.  The two features I saw were Class B pictures: a dog film with a slight touch of flag waving for the children of America and a western.  A like a western once in a while.  I saw “Tall in the Saddle.”  It had the usual plot: the two-fisted gunfighters, horses, and adventurous women and the usual end: the hero marries the persecuted maiden and the villains are done with.

I have been busy lately moving here and there.  I am still in the same place, the same spot.  How long I’ll remain, I don’t know.

I was going to write you during the weekend, but I did not feel in any mood to write.  I would have said and expressed such angry thoughts to be sent to jail for life.  I was wild and mad as a dog.  If I could have put my hands around the neck of that man I hated, I would have given him a tragic few minutes.  I had hopes to be sent home this month.  I had great hopes.  I was cherishing them.  I was dreaming of our life when I reached home.  I was not chosen and have to keep waiting for future months.  I am getting madder and madder every month.  I have been hoping now for twelve months!

Physically, I’m getting along very well.  The news from the Philippine Islands and the Russian front are very encouraging.  I wonder if the Russians will succeed in giving the Germans the last deadly blow?  

Here there is a lapse of two hours.  Fellows started to talk about the war on the Eastern front.  I had to get into the conversation and proffer my own guesses.  I said that the European war should be over by late spring or early summer.  I think I am conservative in my guess.

I hope you’ll read these lines before our anniversary.  I’ll be with you all day that day.  I’ll relive all the things we did and said.

It’s getting hotter and my hands are sweating.  I’d better close my letter.  

I send you my best love and many, many kisses.  I do love you.

											I am yours,

											Silvio

My darling and beloved wife,

Last night, I received your Valentine.  Thank you, darling.  The thought is beautifully expressed in sweetly flowing words.  I wish I were with you on that day and on the other one that precedes it by a week.  Today, we have been married 154 weeks and we were together only one out of fifteen.  We have to change that equation.

How are you, darling?  I have not received any news from you for a while.  It looks like the mail service is getting bad again.  Probably it is the same on the other way.  I’m sorry for you, but it is beyond my control.  However, we should be thankful.  I’ve received some of your letters in eight days.  What a welcome change from the time it took six weeks!

I’m well.  It’s a cool, wet day.  It rains slowly, as it does in April or May at home.

Last night, I saw a good picture “To Have and Have Not.”  I enjoyed it.  It was well acted and the plot was original.  The lines were witty, sometimes caustic, but always to the point.  It’s one picture that I would like to see again.

I have been a little bit busy, moving here and there, but had enough time to do some reading.  I’m reading an Indian love story “Laughing Boy.”  I have never read any book dealing with the life of a present day Indian.  Do you remember the religious ceremony we witnessed in New Mexico?  This book deals with the Navajo tribe.  So far, it has been good reading.

The war news is good.  The Russian armies are stunning the world.  We are not doing so badly.  The sooner it’s over the better.  I’m tired of this war and am looking forward eagerly to a period of peace.  I want peace in a bad way.  I want to be home.  I want to be with you forever.  I want to live with you, be with you, love you.

I hope this letter will reach you on or around our anniversary.  I’d like you to receive it and read that I do love you and that I am very happy to have married you.  I only wish that I had married you sooner.

I love you very, very much.  Have a special kiss, hug, and an embrace.

I love you.  I’m always yours “always and forever.”

My darling Annette,

Yesterday, the General, following a simple ceremony, pinned the medal on my shirt and thanked me for the service I’ve given to the Division.  We shook hands.  It was the first time that I shook hands with a two-star General.  After the ceremony was finished, I received the medal, placed it in a special holder, and mailed it to you.  It was not in my possession longer than fifteen minutes.  I hope you like it.

I’m feeling well.  It’s hot today.  I’m sweating while I write.  Today, I end my eighth month on this island.  This is the longest period of time I ever passed in one place since I joined the Army.

I have not received any mail for quite a while.  It was going too well to last.  But we are at war and we have to expect a change for the worst in the mail service once in a while.

I hope you’ll get this letter on our anniversary.  

I wish to tell you that I’m very lucky to be married to you and that I do love you with all my heart and body.

									Always and forever yours,

									Silvio

My darling Annette,

Your letter of January 14 was cordially welcome.  I had not heard from you for a few days.  I was right in blaming the delay on the mail.  It took this letter nearly two weeks to reach me from the usual of eight or nine days.  

By the time you read this letter, our anniversary will have come and gone.  We will be on our fourth year.  Our fourth year will be a must.  We must meet again, we must be together again.  The time drags on.  I hope it will not be long before I’ll sail for home.  I’m dreaming of springtime in New England!

I’m feeling well.  It’s hot.  The nights are warm.  There is not much ventilation.  I have a comfortable bed with a pillow and sheets.  During the last two nights, I have not used a blanket, not even my pajamas, just a pair of shorts, native-like.

I have been eating very good food, three regular meals a day.  These are as good as you find anyplace in the States.  This morning, for instance, I had pineapple juice, pears, coffee, and pancakes with butter and exquisite syrup for breakfast.  A colored enlisted man is serving the meals.  It’s high class, I would say.  It would be ideal if it wasn’t for the stifling heat.

I have ended my eighth month in this area of the South Pacific.  Considering everything, it was not such a bad period.  I preferred it to my periods passed in Australia.

The news from the European front is very encouraging.  I wait with anxiety for the news broadcast.  Every new success brings me hope and shortens my time to serve in the Army.

My paper is getting short.  Will you please write to my folks and tell them that I’m getting along all right?

I do not blame you if you keep your home cozy and warm.  They cannot expect you to sacrifice everything.  You have been sacrificing a great deal already.  I’m sorry that you had to suffer from a cold.  I wish I could be by your side and nurse it.

It’s approaching noon time.  I’d better close and get ready for the meal.  I feel hungry and thirsty.  I’m going to get a glass of iced water.

I love you, darling.  I love to dream of times to be.

										I’m all yours,

										January 31, 1945

My darling Annette,

The mail is getting satisfactory again.  I read yesterday your letter of January 18.  I’m glad we have settled the question of Christmas and that we are both pleased.

A week from today, we’ll remember our third wedding anniversary.  I had hoped to be on my way home by then.  It is true that I am on the move again, but not yet toward home.

At the moment, I am on board a ship.  It’s a welcome change.  I enjoy good food, a nice bed, and friendly company.  The only thing I do not like is the excessive heat.  The nights are oppressively hot and enervating on board ship.  The days are warm, but bearable.  I am going to put on some weight.  The food is too good, well prepared and elegantly served.  

I take care of my men as usual.  I have a lot of time to read and play cards.  I’m trying to get a Spanish grammar.  I want to learn some Spanish.  It would help me to pass the time quickly and keep my mind doing something.

I have seen a movie every night.  Last night, I only saw half a picture.  The machine broke and I was waiting.  I’m still waiting.

I am trying to get another heavy tan.  I take my shirt off and stay in the sun.  While in camp, I never bothered to get a sunbath.  I preferred the coolness of the tree shade in the comfort of my tent.

How are you?  When are you going to visit New York and Washington?  You’d better wait until the climate is mild.  I do not like traveling during the coldest season of the year.  If you go to Washington, you can stop in and visit Lena.  She will be very happy to see you.  Do you remember the evening we went to see her?  It was nearly three years ago.

I have been dreaming and looking forward to the day I’ll travel again in your company.  I’m tired of traveling lonesomely in a crowd.  I like to see the world and move around, but in your company.  I’ve met enough strangers to be satisfied for all my life.

Have a special kiss for the seventh of February and many, many more.

I do love you.

											I’m yours,

											Silvio

My darling Annette,

I just had breakfast.  I ate a good breakfast: fruit, cereal, pancakes with butter and delicious syrup and a good cup of coffee.  To make it complete, I got a sheet with the latest news of the war.  As you know, the news is very good at present and helps to keep my morale sky high.  I am wondering how long the Germans will keep on taking it under their hard chins.

I received a letter from Mrs. Vioni and her husband.  Do you remember them?  We visited them in Port Chester.  Mrs. Vioni asked for your address.  She sends you her best wishes.   If you want to write her, this is her address: Rose Marie Vioni, 307 Putman Avenue, Port Chester, New York.  I’m supposed to write them, but at present I have a limited number of envelopes and writing paper.  I don’t want to be caught without stationery and be unable to write to you.

I’m feeling fine.  I’ll be spoiled by the Navy food.  I do not know why I did not join the Navy.  That is the real life.  The life on board is smooth, easy, pleasant.  I pass the time of the day by reading, playing cards, or studying Spanish.  I’m at my fifth lesson.

I see a motion picture every night.  Last night, the sky was studded with bright stars, a soft, cool breeze was blowing and the sea was dark, silent and motionless.  It’s a pleasure to see a picture on a ship with no mosquitoes buzzing around.

Tomorrow, I start my fifth year in the service of Uncle Sam.  He has not treated me well during the last three years.  He has not given me any leave or only seven days, an average of two days a year!

It will not be long before we start our fourth year.  If I don’t get to come and see you during the fourth year, I’m going to do something very radical and somebody will pay a very high price for it.  I’m getting fed up and becoming desperate.  I’d better stop complaining even though I have not written everything I think.  I rebel against injustice.  I don’t see why so few have to sacrifice so much and so many so little.  Three years overseas is a long time and nobody in the world can convince me that it is right.

I send you all my love until my next letter.  

I love you, darling, very, very much.  I miss you more than ever.

										I’m all yours,

My darling and beloved wife,

I wish I were back today where we were three years ago at this time.  Do you remember when we left the chapel and we kissed each other?  How proud I was!  Do you remember?  It is sweet to remember.  It is pleasant to wander in the memories of the past and at the same time, it is bitter and heartbreaking to think that we are separated on this day of all days.

Today is our day.  It is our common day.  It belongs to us, only to us and entirely.  I wish I could be with you.  I wish I could show, demonstrate to you how much I love you, whisper to you that I love you, that I am proud to be your husband, that I’m immensely proud to have you as my wife, the girl of my dreams, the girl I love and will always love.

I’m well.  It’s hot, especially at night.  The food is excellent.  Life is tense, but peaceful.  I’m following a daily routine.  I read a great deal.  I just finished “For Whom the Bell Tolls.”  It’s raw and exciting and keeps the reader suspended and anxious.  It’s true to life.  It’s cruelly true to human nature with its weaknesses and virtues.

Darling, I love you.  Hoping to be together next year.

										I love you.

My darling Annette,

I just finished eating breakfast and reading the news sheet.  I had a cup of tomato juice, a bowl of cornflakes cereal and a couple of pancakes with good syrup.  I washed everything down with a cup of good coffee.  The news sheet was very heartening.  The American army is in Manila.  The best news I have heard in months!

How are you, darling?  There is a cold wave crossing the United States and I am sure it will hit Lowell and you.  I wish you could share some of the heat I have to warm you during the night.  I do not mind the day.  I can say that I like it on the bridge during the sunlight.  It’s windy and pleasant.  I can take the sun without any trouble.  I have a first-class suntan.  Am I brown!  But the nights are stifling!  I sweat most of the time.  The sleep is irregular and tiresome, a succession of tossing to left and right.  I sleep in my shorts and find them to be too much to wear.  

I have time to read.  I was seasick for a day.  I did not vomit.  I only felt nauseated.  I did not miss a meal, however, not a single bite.  The food is too good to bother with the stomach.

I love you, my beloved, very much.

										I am always yours,

										February 12, 1945

My darling wife,

I am sitting on the front seat of my jeep.  I am writing on this paper that lies on my knees.  It’s early afternoon.  The sky is partially covered by a cloudy haze that is not thick enough to keep the darting and burning sun from transforming this dry, treeless rice paddy into an oven.  Even the wind is blowing at a remarkable speed.  I say remarkable because during the past three years, I have never experienced any wind that had a speed higher than ten or twenty miles an hour.  The weather is exceedingly dry.  My lips are parched.  My skin is dry.  I am not used to such dry weather.  

As you may already have guessed, I am writing to you from the Philippine Islands where I landed three days ago.  I have been busy doing nothing.  That is quite exactly what it amounts to, all my moving and fretting.  There is not much showing of the work I do when I start a new camp.

You may wonder how I like the Philippines.  I don’t.  I am pro-Philippino and 100% “the Philippines to the Philippinos.”  I may change my mind.  From what I’ve seen, I may draw no other conclusion.  The Philippinos like us and are always ready to smile from ear to ear. 

My trip from the previous camp to the present has been uneventful.  Looking back on it, I think it was wonderful except for the nights that were too warm.  The sea was mostly glassy.  A couple of days were choppy and made me feel nauseated.

I am feeling well, but for the climatic inconveniences.  Here, at present, I’m not running any risk whatsoever.  I am well and out of any danger.  I’m not fighting.  My only worry is the heat and the dry wind.  The Japs are not around here.

Our anniversary came and went.  I wish I were back to three years ago and relived every minute of the time we spent together.  Living again, loving again.  I hope that soon I’ll start on my way back home for good.

Will you write to Dad and Mother and tell them that I’m well?  I’ll write them within a few days, as soon as I am settled.

Remember me to your mother and aunt and uncle.

I love you very, very much.  Have many and many kisses.

										I’m all yours,

My darling sweetheart,

Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day.  I have not had a chance to send you a card.  I have not had a chance to think of it until today.  This moving from one place to another and the continuous tension and suspension in which I lived made me forget the usual events of civilization.  I know you do understand me.  

I’m well and today in good condition.  I’m not as tired as I was a few days ago.  My tent has been set up and the sun is not so fierce when it is separated from me by a good tent canvas. 

It’s early evening.  It was warm today.  I’m getting used to it.  The wind was mild.  Now it’s ideal.  A starry night.  I can see the North Star for the first time in years.  There is a soft breeze blowing from the sea.  I’m writing you by the electric lights that light my tent.  I did not go to the movies tonight because I wanted and needed to have a chat with you and tell you on Valentine’s Day Eve that I do love you and tell you that you are my Valentine and that I want you to be my Valentine forever. 

Last night, I went for a swim to a river a short distance from my camp.  Tonight, I did not need to because we have a shower working.  One thing I do not like here is the water.  It does not taste any good.  I have been spoiled by the cold water I used to drink on the way here.

I’ve seen a few Philippinos.  They are ready to smile.  They are friendly and I would say a little bewildered at our efficiency and resourcefulness.  They wear clothes of a cheap and rustic material.  The clothes have the appearance of the homespun clothing of the pioneers.  Some houses are modern.  The average one is not any better than the average house in which the Negroes live in the Southern states.  The Philippinos are small Orientals.  I have a hard time to distinguish them from the Chinese or Formosans, even the Japanese.  The features are so similar.

I have seen goats and cows.  These are as big and large as ours, but have straight horns.  They have a grayish color.  I am wondering if it’s their natural color or if it’s due to the mud and dust that they collect on their hides.

Soon, I’ll start to read some books and start a new sedentary life.  I hope not for long because I want to come home and be with you instead of dreaming of being with you.

I love you very much.

											I’m all yours,

My darling Annette,

Another Sunday!  Another lonesome Sunday!  It’s a hot, dry, windy day.  You may wonder how a windy day can be hot at the same time, but here it is.  The lack of mail makes me irritable and bitter.  I have not received any mail for the past two weeks.

Moreover, I have not been chosen to be sent home.  I know what you think.  I know what adjectives you like to apply to those responsible.  I can and think much worse of them.  I do not know who is worse and do not know what I am fighting for.  What is the use of talking of great ideals when the most fundamental and natural desires are denied to me, not only for one year, but two and soon three years?  Is this democracy?  Is this the way to the pursuit of happiness when not even a sample is allowed to me to taste?  Is there any more humanitarianism left in the hearts of men?  Is this the way a nation rewards the men who serve faithfully?

I have been on this island for ten days.  Now that I am getting used to the climate, it is not so bad.  The weather is dry, very dry.

Today, I went to see a cockfight for the first time in my life.  I saw the cocks spurring each other to death.  It was a gruesome fight.  You should see the raging birds attacking each other.  To understand it means to understand the mind of the Philippino people.  You should see the emotions that the Philippino men show on their faces while the fight goes on.  The winner is jubilant and the cock who won is exhausted.  The cock who lost feels no more.  I never imagined that these people would like gambling and betting so much.  The people have cockfights every Sunday and bet large amounts of money.  What would you say if you saw a man in rags betting $200. on a horse?

The Philippinos are small people.  Some are well-to-do, the majority poor people who live in shacks made of straw.  There are wooden shacks and a few, very few, houses.

I am still hoping to be sent home.  I must be home by spring and nobody is going to stop me, even if I have to stowaway.

I love to relive the ten weeks we had together.  It was three years ago!  Think of it!  Three years ago!  I’m looking forward to enjoy the same happiness, to live as a man should live.

Life is easy here.  There is no danger.  I see movies, hear the radio, read books, and as you read do my share of complaining.  I am getting more skillful at it every day.

I do love you.  You are always in my thoughts and my dreams.
											I’m all yours,

My darling Annette,

Today, after two weeks, I received your first mail.  I’m glad you received mine in record time.  I was very anxious to know how you were coming along.  I’m sorry and glad that you are going to change your job.  I hope you’ll like it.  Tell those men who like to make cracks that if they don’t respect you, I’ll simply blow their brains out when I come home.  I’m fighting the Japs to keep them from doing any harm to my dear ones and especially my wife.  I’ll take care of any yellow bastard who at home has the appearance of a white man and the heart of a Jap.  I understand what it means to do the same things day after day.  It gets on your nerves.  It gets on my nerves too.

I hope that you do not have to stand it much longer.  I’ll be home in the near future and when together, we will forget all the suffering we went through.  The thought of all the hardships, physical and mental, will make our happiness greater and deeper.  Do not bother with those miserable worm creatures who are hiding behind desk jobs at home while men fight at the front.

I’m feeling well as usual, but fed up with Army life and its treatment of the men who do their duty.

It’s warm and windy.  I’m getting fairly good food again.  There was a time during the past week that I had to eat to live.

I love you with all my heart.

My darling Annette,

It’s early evening.  The sun disappeared in a glorious glow.  Slowly, nearly imperceptibly, the evening came and with it a few glittering stars.  The half moon is up high in the sky right on top of my head.  It’s quiet and calm.  The wind does not blow.  The camp is silent, motionless.  Everybody has gone to the movies to see “Stand Ready for Action.”  It’s an old picture and I have seen it twice.

Finally, darling, your mail came in.  I got a few of your letters.  I know it was not your fault.  I know that you do write me often.  You know that your letters mean everything to me.  They change my mood as the sun changes nature at sunrise, from a gloomy, pessimistic outlook in life to a bright one. 

Oh, how happy I’ll be when I’ll be back with you!  We have a lot of things to do.  I’m enjoying myself dreaming.  It’s like a preview of the happiness to come, of the happiness that we have sacrificed and suffered so much for and are still suffering to achieve.   I hope it will not be long before we will be together again.  This war will end someday and I’ll stop hopping from island to island in the South Pacific.

I was bitter yesterday and before against rotation.  However, considering everything, the man who was chosen did not need it as much as I do, but he does deserve it.  He has been overseas three months longer than I have and has gone through the grinding of one more campaign.  I’m getting near the top of the list.  If I do not get a break, I have some other plans.  I think and know that I have done my share.  If every American soldier had done as much as I did, the war would be over by now.  This is how I feel.  I don’t think I got the breaks I deserve.

How do you like your new “job?”  Do you have a more congenial crew working with you?  Soon, you have been working for nearly a year.  When are you going to Washington?  Why don’t you wait until after March?  April is beautiful in Virginia.

How is the cold?  By the time you read these lines, the winter should be nearly over.  At least the most severe part of the winter.  I guess I’ll have to wait until fall to admire your winter coat, if by then it will still be fashionable.

Do you remember three years ago?  We were visiting Dad and Mother in New Rochelle.  Do you remember you went to Boston from Larchmont?  I did not like to be separated from you.  I had a feeling in my bones that our time was short.  I have a feeling now that we will be together in the near future and I do hope with all my heart that I am right.

I love you very much.

											Silvio

My dearest darling,

Your letters of February 6 and 11 reached me only a few minutes ago.  I’m sorry, darling, but that was all I was allowed to say in my letters written on the boat.  By now, you can explain a lot of things that puzzled you at that time.  You know that I’m on an island in the Philippines and that then I was on my way to the Philippines.  I can’t write you about what I am going to do and where I’m going.  I can only tell you what I did and where I was.

It will be hard to believe, but this morning I nearly froze to death.  It was not cold by your standard.  I guess it was at 60 degrees.  But was it cold!  I shivered.  I slept very well, however, under my woolen blanket and a poncho.  It was cozy and warm and I hated to get up for breakfast.  Today, it’s hot again.  It did not take the sun very long to warm up the air. 

I’m feeling well.  I’m well tanned and I do love you.  I hate to read that you worry about me.  You know I take good care of myself and can always come out on top.  It takes me time, but I always succeed.

I love you with all my heart and think that you are the grandest person I ever met and the girl I love more than anything else in the world.

										I love you.

My darling Annette,

I have a few minutes left to myself before I start my daily routine.  Today is another burning day.  The wind has subsided and it’s really hot.  I’m all wet even though I have not done a thing yet.  It does not bother me much, however.  I wish I could share some of your cold weather.  Soon March will be here and milder weather I hope.

I’m feeling well, but I miss you tremendously.  It breaks my heart to see fellows going home on rotation and to be left behind.  Someday I may lose my patience and make somebody pay very highly for my sufferings.

I’d better close my letter before I start to complain too much and hurt the feelings of the censor.

I love you very much and always will.

My darling Annette,

I have not written you for an entire week.  I have received, however, your mail up to February 14 and loved to read every word.

At the beginning of last week, I was so sick that I did not care if I lived or died.  I never felt like that.  It was nothing serious, but plain seasickness.  I vomited every meal and kept on eating at every meal.

Since I landed, I have been feeling fine and hungry.  I’m hungry now and anxiously waiting for the noon meal.

I like this island.  I have drunk a lot of coconut juice and eaten the pulp.  I landed here on the last day of February.  I have moved around and seen beautiful scenery.  I even bathed in a hot spring.  The water is so warm that I nearly scalded myself.  Yet, there has not been any excitement.  And I guess there will not be.  The natives are friendly and very clean, nearly immaculate.  They are quite different from the natives of New Guinea.

I’m feeling well.  Do not worry about me because I know how to take care of myself.  I mean my body.  I do not know how to take care of my heart that is always eager to come back to you.  I miss you, darling.  I have you always in my thoughts.  

I love you very, very much.  Have a million kisses.

My darling Annette,

I have not had a chance to write you during the past weeks.  I have not been very busy, but always on the move.  I went through very rough terrain.  I’m again sleeping in a foxhole and have again slept in a pool of water.  Notwithstanding, I am feeling well and have not lost any weight.  

I have not seen a Jap yet, not even a dead one, since I landed on this island two weeks ago and with the exception of great physical discomfort, I have been without fear and mental anxiety.

I have not heard any news from you for more than a week.  I have drunk a lot of coconut juice and like it.  After I finish writing this letter, I am going to the beach and swim for a while.  It’s warm, but not excessive.

Even though I sleep in a foxhole, even though my bones ache, you are still and always in my thoughts.  I hope it will not be long before I’ll enjoy a soft bed, clean sheets and your company.  

I’ll write you again soon.  Do not worry about me because I know how to take care of myself.

I’m all yours and love you with all my heart.

My darling wife,

Yesterday, I received your letters of February 19, 21 and 24.  They were heartily welcome.  I did not read them, but devoured them with my eyes.  I am sorry to read that you went through an unpleasant experience caused by the weather.  That will give you an idea of what I have been going through in the jungle.  At least you can look forward to a warm home and a soft bed.  More than once I saw the shadows of the night falling on wet ground from a rainy sky.  More than once recently, I lay down for a “rest” during the dark hours of the night on wet ground with my clothes all soaked and wet.  Not even my pocket book was dry.  I dozed in the water and waited for the dawn.

It is a part of Army life and everybody takes it for granted.  Among hundreds of men, I never heard a complaint aloud.  In the morning, it’s common to hear many men joking and making fun of all the tribulations they experienced the night before.

Today, it’s my nineteenth day on this island.  So far, I should not complain.  I haven’t seen a Jap, dead or alive.  It’s hard to find them.  These Japs are quite different from those we encountered in previous engagements.  

At present, I am not very busy.  I cannot write you very often because of the lack of paper.  Moreover, the mail leaves only once a week at present.

Seeing that the enemy has not been aggressive, I promoted myself from the foxhole to the level ground.  Yesterday, I went a step forward and had the natives build me a shack, native-style.  This shack is erected on top of my foxhole.  It’s a couple of feet above the ground.  It consists of four poles stuck in the ground, a platform one yard in width and two in length made of bamboo, and a mat made of coconut leaves.  It’s covered by my poncho that keeps it from getting wet in the rain.  The platform or my bed has a certain amount of elasticity.  It’s not as good as a cot, but much better than the hard ground.  It keeps all kinds of bugs away.  I don’t like to feel the bugs crawling all over my face, unconcerned about my personal feelings.  

While I sit here, to my front in the East is a range of mountain peaks covered with a rain forest of dark green.  Today, the peaks are clear and distinct as if they were washed.  To my left is one of the most beautiful beaches I ever saw.  It’s many miles long and crowned by coconut groves.  The beach slopes gently.  The waves are a couple of yards high and a great source of fun.  I dip myself daily in the sea.  To my right, a clear, cool, fast-moving creek is running.  All around it’s the Philippine jungle.  

The long nights leave me a lot of time to dream.  I do dream lovely dreams.  You and I.  What we will do.  Where we will go.  I hope my dreams will come true someday.  I do love you with all my heart.

								I am all yours,                Silvio

My darling Annette,

It’s early Saturday morning.  I have just finished my daily sick call.  I intended to write you yesterday, but the heat was so depressive that my mind could not gather any thoughts.  This morning is different.  It’s a sunny, bright morning with a cloudy sky and a cool breeze blowing.

Last night, I did not sleep well.  It was too hot and I am not used to sleeping on a soft, comfortable bed.  For the first time in a month, I slept on my cot in white sheets.  The change from a foxhole to a native bed and then to a soft air mattress and bedroll is too sudden and too sharp.  I tossed and turned all night.  At least my bones did not ache, nor did the mosquitoes bite me.

Yesterday morning, I reached this camp.  I had been in the wilderness for seventeen days.  I saw beautiful scenery, crossed rivers, walked through forests of bamboo, climbed rocky hills, plodded through sandy beaches and crawled up and down cliffs sprayed by the splashing waves of the sea.  I flew back.  It was a pleasant trip mixed with some apprehension.  I flew over rolling hills covered with green trees and jungle with a river here and there.  I flew across mountains and above the azure sea.  I wished you were with me instead of the pilot.

I have been on this island since February 28.  Yesterday, I received your letter of March 9.  You were right.  I should say you are right and Dad is wrong.  

I’m feeling well and strangely I’m putting on weight.  

A week from tomorrow will be Easter and I’m sorry that I’ll not make it.  It will be my third and I hope last Easter overseas.

I love you very much.

My darling Annette,

I’m glad you received my medal.  I was anxious about it.  There are too many itchy fingers.  A few days ago, I received a note from Australia asking me what disposition I want to make of a box of clothes stored down there.  Can you beat that!  Do you remember that I sent you a box of clothes when I left Australia?  I’ve been wondering about it.  I told them to send it to you.  I’m curious to know when and if you’ll receive it.

This morning, I was cold.  I had to use a blanket and a sheet to keep warm.  Now it’s warm again.

Last night, I saw “Together Again” with Charles Boyer.  I liked it.  

Since I came back, I have been taking a hot bath every morning.  There is a hot spring about a mile from my tent.  The water is so hot that I cannot keep my hand in it for longer than a few seconds.  It’s warm enough for a sponge bath.  

I received a letter from Dad.  This time he is wrong and you are right.  

I’m sleeping in a tent.  I’m back to an easy life.  How long I don’t know.  I hope soon I’ll be able to enjoy not only an easy life, but also a happy one with you.  It should not be long.

I’m getting quite an experience in treating Philippinos and their tropical diseases.  I see at least a dozen every day.  By the time the war is over, I may have enough experience to take care of any patient in the world!

I’m feeling as well as ever and love you very much.  I’m eager to come home and be with you.

I love you with all my heart.

										Philippine Islands
										April 9, 1945

My darling Annette,

This is the longest lapse of time for a long time that I have not written to you.  I wrote one letter two weeks ago before leaving for a new landing.

The sea voyage from that Philippine island to this one was one of the roughest I ever experienced.  The enemy did not bother me because none was in sight, but the choppy sea did.   I sailed in a small boat that kept rolling, pitching, and rocking all the time.  I vomited so many times that even my bile, the yellow fluid that the liver excretes, found a way out through my mouth.  I was miserable and wretched.

I landed on this island nearly two weeks ago and moved up to the front lines.  I have been in contact with the enemy during the last twelve days.  The fighting has not been very severe, nothing to compare with the previous campaigns.  These Nips do not have guts and are easy prey for our seasoned men.  I heard some bullets whistling in the air, but none landed near me.  

I have not been very busy.  My main troubles have been the mosquitoes that buzz around my head all night.  They are a great nuisance.  I prefer mosquitoes, however, to Japs!   

The terrain was another trouble.  It’s rugged, up and down mountains.  Some places, I had to crawl up and down steep mountains.  I had to wade belt deep in rivers and creeks.  I got wet and slept more than one night in the rain, wet from the belt down.  Luckily, I have been carrying a woolen sweater with me that I wear at night and that keeps me very warm.  I have been sleeping on the hard ground day after day.  I am getting used to it and believe it, I can sleep all night long.  I guess the extreme state of tiredness has something to do with it.  I have been walking through jungle thicker than the New Guinea jungle.  You should see the big, tall trees!  They are as tall as those we saw in northern California.

I have met many Philippinos and heard their gruesome experiences under Jap rule.  The people are ragged.

I don’t know yet when I’ll be sent home.  I hope, however, to be on my way before the spring is over.  I keep my fingers crossed and hope.  I have been looking forward so long for the day I’ll meet you again!  It should be near.  I’m dreaming of all the good times we’ll have together.  Nobody in the world will separate us again.  I love you so much.

											I’m all yours,

P.S.	I received your letters regularly, but could not answer them.  I am feeling fine.

											Love,

My darling Annette,

I have not written to you for quite a while where you have sent me regularly your very much welcomed letters.  I received your mail at short intervals.  I received them while waiting to move on the front lines and while I was on the front lines.  They helped me tremendously in keeping my chin up and gave me the inspiration and strength to meet the challenges.  I feel a little guilty not to have written more often, but it was risky.  White paper shows and is seen for a long distance.  I never liked to attract the attention of the Jap snipers.  Moreover, if I had to write, I had to remain in one spot for some time.  That time would have been sufficient for a Jap sniper to aim accurately at my skull.  

You know very well that I always had you in my thoughts, even when conditions were tough.  Considering everything, however, these two campaigns have not been as risky as the previous one.  For one thing, I was never subjected to enemy artillery, mortar fire and bombers.  I heard crackling of machine gun and sniper fire.  I am used to those and know very well how to duck them.

Both campaigns have been physically hard.  I had to climb mountains, cross rivers, and sleep in the rain.  I have not suffered hunger and thirst.  I had to stand the sweetish, nauseating smell of death.  I never liked the smell of Jap bodies undergoing the state of decomposition.  I have seen horrible sights, but they did not bother me in the least.

I have been on this island for twenty days.  The campaign is now closed and I am resting by the seashore in a majestic coconut grove.  It’s peaceful here.

Last night, I saw a movie.  Yesterday, I took a good shower.  Last night, I slept in pajamas and on sheets for the first time in a month.  I’m feeling well and to my surprise I have not lost any weight to speak of.

Do not worry, darling, nor believe what Hazel’s husband said.  I’ll be home before the duration of the war will come to an end.  I feel that I’ll be able to keep the promise I made you last Christmas.  I guess I’ll be home before your birthday or at least around your birthday.  My chances of being sent home at present are brighter than they have ever been before.  I have done a good job during these two campaigns and expect a reward.  The only reward I want is a trip home for good.

I can’t tell you how much and how eagerly I look forward to it.  I hope the day will be near when I’ll have you in my arms.  I love you, darling.  I love you more than anything else in the whole universe.  Have a million kisses.

											I’m all yours,

My darling Annette,

It was three years ago today that I was rolling through the Oregon plains and wooded northern California toward the port of embarkation and unknowingly toward a stretch of overseas duty that soon will start on the fourth year.  Think of that, three long years separated from each other!  Is it human?  I don’t think so.  I’m disgusted, tired and fed up with the whole thing.

I don’t know yet who is going to be sent home during this month or the next.  I hope I’ll be chosen.  I deserve it and my time has come.  If I’ll not be sent home, I’ll literally and practically raise hell.  I’ll make life so miserable for everybody around me that they have to get rid of me.

My life at present is easy.  I’m in the mood to complain and be bitter.  During combat, I had no time for such a luxury.  You complain that in my recent letters I have not mentioned or given any hint about my desire to come home.  I did not write about it, but I have always felt it.  I felt it a few minutes after I left San Francisco.  I always felt, I will always feel it until I’ll reach you and home.

When I wrote you the two letters, I was in a hurry.  I was getting ready for another campaign.  I preferred to write about the niceties of my surroundings at least for a moment and forget the mysterious future.  I have always felt a sense of suspension, hesitation and fear before leaving for combat.  I tried to pierce the future, but it has always been enigmatic.  So far, everything has turned out well and all my doubts have vanished before reality.  I came out of this campaign untouched by enemy bullets with my whole skin intact.  My mind has not been shocked.  I have not seen anything new, nor experienced any new excitement. 

Do not worry, darling, someday, maybe sooner than you and I expect, I’ll be knocking at your door and between kisses, telling you that I am back home to stay and always be with you.  We will be together to plan our future.  There will be no more uncertain future, no more separations, no more waiting, no more mental and physical suffering.

Meanwhile, let’s wait patiently and hope for the best.  I feel I’ll be seeing you soon.  I hope that my hunches will become realities.

I’m well and 156 pounds.  Last night, I saw “Mr. Lucky” with Cary Grant.  For the first time in a month, I slept on my air mattress with sheets, pajamas, and mosquito nets.  This morning I had fresh eggs for breakfast.  I’m living in a coconut grove overlooking the glassy sea.  It is not as hot as it was in San Jose, Mindoro where I first landed two and a half months ago.

I love you and am all yours	.							Silvio

My darling Annette,

I cannot let this day pass without sending you a note, without remembering that three years ago today, at about this time, I sailed through the Golden Gate Bridge toward the newest world and three whole years of overseas duty.  I start today my fourth year overseas and do hope and pray that it will be my last.  Just to think of it!  I have been three whole years without seeing you, 156 weeks without speaking to you viva voce, 1092 days without kissing you.  The last time I saw you, your eyes were tearing and you had a forced smile on your face.  I’m anxious to see your eyes smiling without tears, to kiss your lips and hug you with the knowledge and consciousness that we will never separate again.

I do not know when I’ll be sent home, but I have great hopes that it will not be very long.  I hope that I’ll make it for your birthday or around there.

I have a comfortable life.  I am living in a big tent with five other officers.  It’s spacious enough for all of us.  We have electric lights and a rustic, but practical, wash stand.  Not far, there is our shower or the beach.  A calm, glassy, always changing color sea is in front and hills and forest are behind.  Tall, majestic coconut trees are partially hiding the blue sky and keeping the burning sun away.  In Mindoro, where I first landed, there were no trees and a strong breeze blew most of the day.  It was not only windy but also dusty, dry, sticky dust that made my throat sore.  Here there is coolness, a lovely breeze, and not excessive heat.  I have not sweated at all since I camped here and at night, I need a sheet and a woolen blanket to keep me warm.  

A few days of rest have restored me to my usual routine.  As it happened in Biak after the campaign, I am left alone.  Nobody bothers me when I have taken care of my routine work.  I can go to town or take a long walk, whatever I want.  I do not go out much.  The roads to town are dusty.  The only time I like to go out is at sundown.  I go to a movie.  The Army has different and various open-air theaters.  There are no theaters for civilians.  I guess they never had any.

The Philippino people are very friendly and very glad to see us.  Our efficiency and attainments leave them speechless.  We do things in a few days that would take them years to achieve.  They like everything about us.  I wish I could buy some souvenirs, but the Philippinos don’t have anything to sell.  The Japs left them clean and ragged.

When I reached the Philippines, I did not mention any great hate for the Japs.  I considered them enemy, fierce, pitiless enemy willing to defend their country and die for it.  I thought they were doing a job as well as they could.  I hated them when they tried to kill me, when they killed my friends and comrades.  On second thought, I considered it all part of the game of war.  Now, I have not pity nor mercy for any Jap.  I will not describe for you the brutalities inflicted upon the people.  Some cannot be told.  I’ll tell you what I saw.  One day, a young man, a civilian, was brought to my station.  He had eight big wounds caused by a Jap.  He tried to stab this young man to death.  He was scared and horrified.  It took time and morphine and plasma to calm him.  He told me that he was the only survivor of thirty-five people who were in his party.  Old people, women, young girls, children, they were all killed.  He was left for dead and luckily escaped under cover of darkness.  Two days ago, I took care of an eight-year-old girl who had a big gash from her right cheek to the neck.  A Jap stabbed her, killed her mother and three sisters, and tortured her father.  These have been my experiences with Jap brutalities.   I thought that these acts were acts of propaganda.  Now, I think that the papers do not describe the horrors of Jap brutality well enough to correspond to the cruel, hard reality.

The life of the camp is soft and comfortable.  The men are already playing basketball or volleyball, pitching horseshoes, or going fishing.  We already have a lot of pets.  Nearly every tent except the officers’ tents has a few chickens or roosters tied to a rope.  They don’t last long.  They all end in the frying pans.  The Colonel has bought a small pig for $2.50.  He is keeping an eye on it and seeing that it is well fed.  He gets a great kick by looking and listening to the pig eating.

We have many monkeys.  Some are domesticated, some are independent.  There was one on my tent this morning, a cute little devil who knows how to steal bananas and puts his dirty fingers on everything he sees and likes to feel.  He likes to climb on the top of the tent and start jabbering and making faces.  Is he agile!

I see that you are going to New York for a little while.  Why not wait for the summer?  How many weeks with pay will you get?  You have been working for quite a long time and I bet you have a pool of money.

Hoping to see you soon, I send you all my love and many, many kisses.

											I love you.

My darling Annette,

I enjoyed reading your letter full of sweet remembrances.  When I come home, we will start over where we left off.  We will be able to consider the lapse of time as if it were an overnight separation.  I do not mean now, but when we will meet again.  I say not now because this present time is very slow and seems eternal, never ending.

I am sorry you had to wait for my letters for a long time.  As you know, I was engaged with the enemy.  I wrote to you as soon as it was safe.  I hope you understand the regrettable circumstances I used to live in.

It’s all quiet now.  There is no worry, no tension, no suspension.  Life is flowing on, easy and placid.  I’m back to my garrison routine.  The camp life is the usual life.  I have taken a good rest and regained my appetite.  I am even getting used to my soft bed.  It’s a great pleasure to go to bed.  I pull my mosquito net around my bedroll and there I am in my private apartment.  It’s all mine, it’s all private.  My body is my own.  I do not have to compete with any intruder.  A roving mosquito cannot reach me and has to be satisfied to annoy me with its monotonous buzzing.  The mosquito net is a great invention.  It keeps the mosquito’s needle and my skin well apart.  The bugs, scorpions, centipedes and other insects including crawling ants are forbidden from making my body their hunting grounds.

I have been taking it easy.  I never knew how tired I was until now that I am well rested.

Today, I went out in the bay on a boat, a native boat that a native leased to me.  It’s called a prahoe.  It’s easy to handle and easier to push.  On the way out and back, I marveled at the coral bottom I could see where the water was a few feet deep.  It’s amazing what shapes the coral can build in long centuries of patient work.  I was lost in wonder.

Our camp is getting to be more like a zoo than anything else.  Parrots and geese and a varied multitude of dogs have befriended the soldiers.

I don’t know when I’ll be sent home.  At present, I live in a state of anxious expectancy.  Will I come this month or the next or the next?  I know that I’ll be home soon.  I know that it will not be long before I’ll have you in my arms for keeps.

It’s hard for me to solve your medical problems.  It’s hard to give any sound advice without feeling and seeing.  As far as I know, those days of the month correspond to the period of ovulation.  It’s the time when the ova or egg bursts from the ovaries.  Some people notice it more than others.  I would like to know how long the inconveniences last.  I guess we will take good care of it when we will start to live again.  My answer is not satisfactory.  It’s all I can tell you from what you write in your letter.

You have not mentioned how the car is faring.  Is it in good shape for a long ride in the heat of the summer sun?  How are the tires?  How is the gasoline?   Can you save some for use by me and you?  How are our savings?  Do we have enough to buy a cozy house for ourselves?

How are your mother, aunt and uncle?  Give them my best regards. 

Don’t forget to brush up on your cooking.  I am waiting to eat the food you’ll cook.  I guess you did not have much time left for culinary exploits since you went to work downtown. 

I’ll be seeing you.  With all my love, I am all yours.

											Silvio
