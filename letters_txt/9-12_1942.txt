My darling Annette,

I do not know what I would give to be able to turn the clock back seven months to be back in Carlisle on the eve of our wedding.  Do you remember, darling?  I came to see you at the hotel.  Oh, I do wish that days like those will come back soon.  But for the time being, I must comfort myself by reliving my memories, and not without pleasure.  This morning, while reading a poem by Wordsworth, I found these beautiful lines.  I think they are the best verses I have read for a long time.

	“...oft, when on my couch I lie
	In vacant or in pensive mood,
	They flash upon that inward eye
	Which is the bliss of solitude,
	And then my heart with pleasure fills.”

Some days ago, while reading a novel by Maugham, I was struck with this line: “I look forward to that day with eager longing.”  This is exactly how I feel.  I hope that it will not be very long.  I have a feeling that things will change.  For one thing, I do not feel as pessimistic as I felt when I left the country.

How are you, darling?  The heat will be over by the time you receive this letter and you will enjoy the fall.  I am moving toward the spring and the hot weather.  Darling, do not worry about me.  I am feeling fine, have a good appetite, and eat good food.  If I had you here with me, I would be perfectly happy.

Here, it is Sunday.  I had my lunch.  It consisted of a dish of meat with potatoes, gravy, tomatoes, onions, sweets and ice cream.  My fellow officers are a very congenial group of men.  There is always some kidding or joking going on during the meals.

Would you like to know what I do?  I am up every morning before the sun.  The sun is lazy.  It never gets up before 6 A.M. I have breakfast at sunrise, take care of the patients, take a walk, teach the men, and read some books.  The days are always the same.  My life is not much different from the one I was living in the U.S. when I was not with you.  I go to town very rarely.  I see Berger and Pepe and Paul occasionally.

I like to read books.  It is the only thing that keeps the blues away.

I have not heard anything about the job that you mentioned in your previous letters.  Do not forget, darling, that if you do not like the work, let it go.  But if you like it, it will be a good pastime and at the same time you will help Uncle Sam win the war.  We are in it now and we have to win it cost what it will cost.  We can show them that we are not softies any more.

How are your mother and aunt and uncle?  Any news from Lowell?  How are the sisters at the hospital?  Do you ever see them?  Do you hear often from Dad?  Poor Dad!  He is not used to writing in English and I am sure that he tries to do his best not to make any mistakes. 

I have received the letters of July 22 and 28 you sent me.  Your letters are a happy occasion for me, the brightest spot in my life abroad.  Do not forget that I do not like to read anything against the letters that my wife writes to me.  I think they are the best letters I ever read.

I like the cartoons you sent me.  I got a good laugh out of them.  I do not think, however, that I will ever be such a fan of golf to overlook my professional duties.  Whenever I have the chance, I go to the golf course.  I am sorry that I cannot go more often.  I like the game very much.  

I doubt that the age limit will be good for medical officers.  I am going to try it anyhow.

I am keeping busy studying words.  By the time I come back, I hope I will have achieved some improvement.  But, even if I do not, I like the work and I get a kick by doing it.  Do you remember that last Christmas you told me that the word “iron” is pronounced i-ern?  I came across this word last night and my memories went back to our trip to Boston.

My sweet, darling wife, I would like to be able to kiss you.  I have to be satisfied with sending you many, many kisses.  I love you very, very much.

						

							I am all yours,

							Silvio


P.S.	I have received your Fourth of July firecrackers.  They were excellent.  I have the box of candy, but not the candy.  I ate it all already.  The officers helped me.  Shall I wait for some more?

My very darling Annette,

I am sorry to have kept you in the dark for some time.  I could not help it.  It was not my fault.  If I had written, I knew that I could not mail it.  I cannot tell you why.  I sent a couple of v-mail letters that I do hope you have received.  We do not get enough of these letters.  I wish you would send me some by enclosing them in the usual letter envelopes.  If I had some v-mail blanks, I could write to you more often.  This time, I was very lucky with your mail.  I received the letters you sent me August 15 and 24 two weeks after you mailed them.

I thank you for the good wishes you sent me for my birthday.  I have a month to go, but I am glad to receive them in advance, rather than late.  You teach me a lesson for next year.

My darling wife, do not worry about me.  I am taking good care of myself.  As I told you before, I am well fed and clothed.  I am performing my duties, trying to do my utmost.   I dedicate all my free time to reading.  I am consistently struggling to improve my diction and my vocabulary.  I study phonetics, take lessons every day for an hour or two after supper, listen to the radio and to people speaking, and practice reading aloud.

Some time ago you asked me what radio programs I listen to.  Most of the programs are Australian and are transmitted by short wave from San Francisco in the early hours of the morning.  I mean 2 or 3 A.M.

Darling, the candy you sent me was very good, so good that it is already all gone.  Most of it went down into my throat and into that of my fellow officers.

Four days ago, I celebrated our seventh month by working very hard.  I did my best to save a life for Uncle Sam and some mother in the States.  I am proud of it.

It is now 4 o’clock in the afternoon.  I got up early this morning, took care of the sick, gave a two-hour lecture, censored some mail, took a walk, and now I am with you.  

How are you, darling?  How is everything at home?  How are your mother and aunt?  Did you start working yet?

I am comfortable, but not happy.  How can I be so far away from you?  It is a good time to dream.  Dreamland is an excellent refuge from reality.  I love to get lost in sweet memories.  I wish I could kiss you, hold you in my arms, pat you, squeeze you tight against my breast.  Darling, I love you immensely.  Have all my love.  I am all yours forever.
								Your husband,
								Silvio

My darling Annette,

Do you know that I have just received the letters you wrote on August 1 and 7?  This mail is funny!  But I will not complain as long as I receive mail from my darling wife.

How are you, my beloved Annette?  The sultry summer is gone and the wonderful New England fall is here.  Oh, how I wish I could be home with you, to love you, to be with you, and maybe to have a good argument once in a while.  Do you know that I have not had one for so long that I do not know if I will be able to argue any more?

Here, darling, life is going on as usual.  Nothing happens.  I am still studying phonetics.  It takes all my time.  I am glad I picked it up.  I helps to pass the time and gives me something to keep my mind occupied.  Last weekend, I had a couple of games of golf.  I enjoyed them.  I cannot say that I am a good golfer, but I know that I am improving a great deal.  I have seen two pictures.  One was “Within the Law.”  At a certain point, the leading star says that she is from Lowell, Massachusetts.  When those two words were pronounced, my heart had a jump.  I could have screamed that my wife also came from Lowell at the top of my lungs.   

It is starting to be warm.  It is like the summertime at home.  I guess your mother will not envy me from now on.  We will have plenty of warm weather.  

Why don’t you take your mother to a doctor?  Maybe she still has a piece of the root of the tooth in her mouth.  If the dentist cannot help her, take her to a medical doctor.  See Dr. Ryan.  He is a good man.  Mention my name and he will take good care of your mother.  Darling, do not worry until you have a reason to.

I am feeling very well.  I have no complaints.  The food is good.  I have not received your birthday gift yet.  It will come, Annette darling.  Have many and many kisses, millions of them.  I love you immensely.  Thinking and dreaming of you.


								I am always yours,

								Silvio

My darling Annette,

I have not heard from you for the last ten days and I am starting to wonder and worry.  I know that you wrote.  I feel that the mail is on the way, but who knows when it will reach me?  The letter you mailed on August 24 got here two weeks ago.

How are you, my darling wife?  Did you start to work yet?  And if you did, do you like it?

Tomorrow, darling, it is another date.  How many months?  Yes, five long months.  It is five months that I have not seen you.  Five months that I have not kissed you.  How long will they keep us apart?  How many more months?

Friday, I went to town.  I had a day off.  It was shopping day.  Did I tell you that once a month we have a shopping day?  Due to the fact that the dry goods stores in Australia are closed at five o’clock in the afternoon and at noon on Saturdays, we have a day out of every month dedicated to shopping.  I went to town with the thought in my mind to buy something for you.  It was some experience.  I wanted to buy something that you would like and at the same time was typically Australian.  I did not want to buy things, like most of the fellows do, that are imported here from America.  I do not remember how many stores I saw.  I was surprised to find that most of the nice things that you would like to have were made in England, America, or Europe.  I went through a store from floor to top.  Everything was labelled “made in England.”  Finally, I stopped in a jewelry store and was charmed by a sapphire.  I know that you will like the color.  I know that it is an Australian stone even though it was cut in India.  Darling, you can set it in a ring or pin, as you prefer.  The Australians are forbidden by law to do any setting.  I included it in a box of artificial and typical Australian flowers.  The choice of the color of the flowers and sapphire is not occasional or accidental.

I had a game of golf and saw a picture in the evening.  I saw “Unfinished Business” and liked it.

Here it is spring.  I wake in the morning.  I have the pleasure of listening to the singing of birds and can they sing!   The days are longer and warm.  Sometimes I wonder if it is so warm in the spring, how warm will it be in the summer?  Local people tell me that the summer is very warm here.  I do not mind the heat.  I always liked it.  I have already acquired a good tan.  By the time the summer will be over, I will be as black as a Negro.

Did I tell you that I had a private patient?  I was in a small village by the sea.  I was the only doctor around.  A baker was sick.  I made the diagnosis of appendicitis and sent him to the hospital.  I can’t tell you how I felt.  I really felt very well and flattered when they asked me what my fee was.  I did not charge anything, but surely I had the thrill of my few months spent in this continent.

My darling wife, I miss you tremendously.  I am longing for the day when I will sail back home.  Oh that will be a grand day!

Darling, I love and adore you.

							I am always yours,


							Silvio


P.S.	I hope you do not mind my sending you typewritten letters.  I like to type letters for you.  I do love you, my darling wife.

							Always your husband,

							Silvio

My darling wife,

I am sitting on my cot.  It’s a hot afternoon made comfortable by a soft, warm wind.  This morning, I came back from the field tired, unshaved, and dirty.  I had a good shower, shaved, brushed my teeth, had a good rest and a good dinner.  Now I feel right to be with you.  I feel I am ready to talk to you.

Before I left for the field, I received the letters you wrote on September 9 and 13.  I received, too, all the letters you wrote me between August 20 and the middle of September.  Your letters do something to me.  They brighten my days abroad.  They are an oasis in this desert of life.

Here life is running as usual.  I am in the same place.  Nothing is new.  I am getting the same news you get from the radio.  I played golf last weekend, but I had bad luck.  I lost all the golf balls I had.  I am improving my game some.  I play better than I played last year.

I went to the movies with Paul.  Can you guess what I saw?  I saw “Joan of Paris.”  I was back in New York the night of our wedding.  

I have a feeling that by the time I come back, you’ll be an excellent cook.  You’ll have great dinners and I’ll sit at the table much longer than I used to.  I will even get fatter.  I like applesauce.  I am not so keen about it but I like it.  I wish I were home to pick the pears from your pear tree.

I am carrying on.  Some times I am blue and really down in the dumps.  Some other times I am in high spirits and hopeful.  I have given up hopes of promotion.  I am singing with the rest of the men: “There will be no promotions on this side of the ocean, so BLESSED them all.”   

Darling, I sent you a sapphire and some Australian paper flowers.  I hope you will receive them.  You may have the sapphire set in a pin or a ring as you prefer.  

My beloved wife, have all my kisses and my undying love.  I love you with all my heart.  

Always and forever, I am your husband.

My darling wife,

I was going to write you on October 7 to commemorate our eight-month anniversary.  But when in Lowell it was 9 o’clock in the morning, here it was midnight.  That noon when I made my coffee, I put too much powder in the boiling water.  You know that I do not drink much coffee, though lately I have taken a cup every morning.  On October 7, I expected to have a long walk in front of me so I took a good dose of coffee to keep myself in trim.  I did not walk so that evening I could not sleep for many hours and kept counting the hours.  At midnight, I was reliving our wedding minute by minute.  The place I was in was not a romantic one.  I had no ceiling to look to.  I had no walls to look to.  I was lying on the Australian ground and liked it.  Do you remember what I told you when we were crossing the hills of Tennessee about seven months ago?  Today I have one thing in my favor.   I was and am mentally prepared for the hardships of life.  I am grateful to my father that he always insisted in getting us children used to the hard life.  His contention was that it is very easy to get used to a soft life, but very hard to get used to a difficult life.  And he’s right!

Soon it will be a half year since we kissed each other.  Oh, how I miss your kisses!  Many times I wonder how long I must wait before I will be able to come back to you.  I cannot tell you how I feel when I do not get good news about the war.  I feel that the worse the news are, the longer they will keep me away from you.  But I hope that one happy day I will come back home to enjoy a fully happy married life.  And have many, many children!  

I am feeling fine.  You are right that many people seem to enjoy themselves while others suffer.  Darling, do not forget that everybody has his ups and downs.  Looking eagerly for our ups.

I send you all my love.  Have millions and millions of kisses.  

									I adore you,


									Silvio

My darling Annette,

I thank you, my darling wife, for your telegram.  It reached me just in time.  You have been luckier than I was, or rather I was luckier.  I really had an uneventful birthday.  You were the only one who wished me a happy one.  I forgot to tell the officers that it was my birthday.  As usual I got up in the morning.  I had breakfast at 3 A.M. and went to sleep under a tree until dawn.  I had a good ride and enjoyed the weather.  I had some hope that I was going to have a glass of beer but I could not find any.  However, I was happy.  I had a telegram that my darling wife had sent me ten days before.  I read it a few times.

Now I am typing this letter while the men are struggling with their papers.  I gave them a small exam.  I consider it my exam too.  I will have an idea from the papers how good a teacher I am.  It is funny to see them.  They are all very serious.  So far I did not see any case of one man trying to copy from another.

Here, a long pause.  The ribbon of the typewriter became loose.  I had to fix it.  By now, all the papers have been handed in to me.  I read a few.  They are satisfactory.  Most of them are good.  I am kind of pleased!

Here I am at the beginning of my thirty-sixth year.  What kind of year will it be?  I will not mind the hard work nor the hardships that are in store for me.  It will be a happy one if I am able to see my beloved wife.  They cannot keep us apart for more than a year.  Here life is the same.  I am feeling very well.  I have no complaints but one and that is that I  
would like and love to be with you.

I received Auntie’s letter.  Will you thank her for me?  I am going to write her a letter someday.  Remember me to your mother and uncle.

Have many, many kisses.  I adore you.  Have all my love.

									I am all yours,

									Silvio

									October 19, 1942

My darling wife,

Saturday noon, before I went out for my weekend, I received the letter that you wrote me September 17th and the v-mail you wrote me on September 23rd.  It really was a wonderful beginning for my weekend. 

I do not have to tell you what I did.  You guessed it!  Yes, I played golf and was I bad!  Can you imagine me playing with an old champion!  I met him at the golf course.  He invited me to join his group.  Paul could not come.  He was busy.  Not only did I play golf with him.  He invited me to his house to dinner and then to sleep.  I met his people: his wife, his son and his daughter.  They were very kind to me and I really felt homesick.  The daughter, by the way, was married a week before we were.  We were a bit luckier than they were.  Her husband had to leave her four days after they were married.  At least we had ten short weeks!  This is the first time I have been eating and sleeping at the same time in an Australian house.  

These people, the Taylors, are very clean.  The husband is an inspector of mines.  He is a very nice fellow and an excellent golf player.  Can he hit the ball!  It took me two strokes to get the same distance he got with one.  The wife is a nice lady who likes to play cards, especially bridge.  Can you see me playing bridge?  To be a good sport, I played it for a while.  She really knows the game.  She is as good at bridge as her husband is at golf.  You should see all the trophies he has.  He was once a champion of the state.  

The daughter is a thin, tall lady of your age and does not talk much.  She is living with her folks.  I guess she is in love with her husband.  She has his picture in every room of the house and I did not hear her talking about anything else but her husband.  As you see, darling, we are not the only ones who are suffering from this war.  The son is a young man, still going to school.  I have not seen him much.  

These people are very polite.  They eat like the English do.  They hold the knife between the thumb and the index finger of the right hand like a pen.  Here they usually eat cold meals due to the heat.  They eat meat once a day.  They like fruit, but they cannot afford it since the American soldiers are in town.  These soldiers eat all the fruit that is available.  You know very well that I am one of those that keeps the Australians fruit-free.  I like the tangerines and the oranges.  And when I start I eat them by the dozens and no kidding about it either.

I am glad that you are walking more than you used to.  I am a good walker.  I have never dropped out from any long march yet.  I am sure that I can beat everybody around here in mountain climbing.  You should see me!  And can I sleep!  I can sleep any place.  One night I stopped around midnight.  After lying down on the ground with all my clothes and the packs that I was carrying on my shoulders, I fell asleep.

I wish I could be back at the Outpatient Clinic to work with you.  You complain that it is warm at home.  You should try this warm weather!

Will you remember me to Sister St. Yves and Sister Maxime?  Is Sister Maxime still sore at you?  I am glad Med had her appendix out.  She has been suffering long enough because of that appendix.

I am anxious to know if you went to New Rochelle to see my folks.  Maybe a letter on the way will tell me about it.

Yes, Mr.Vioni and Mr. Romanello wrote me.  I want to write them back when I have a chance.  I dedicate most of my free time to write to my beloved wife.  I have to keep up with my reading.  But I promise that I will write a long letter soon. 

 I will be waiting for your picture.  I hope that your nose is all right by now.  I wish you would send me a picture the size of a postcard that I could carry around with me.

Darling, life here is going on as usual.  Nothing is new but what you are able to read in the papers.  I do not have to tell you, but I do miss you all the time.  I hope that one day (and what a wonderful day it will be) that we’ll meet again to stay together.

						
								Love and kisses,

								Silvio

My darling Annette,

Another beautiful Sunday wasted!  It’s a nice, warm day.  We could go to the beach to swim or to take a sun bath or just to walk on the sand.  Instead, I have to stay here and you are far, far away.

Now it is Sunday afternoon.  I just had a substantial dinner.  I ate roast beef and gravy, sweet potatoes, applesauce and cold cocoa.  Today I am on duty.  I have to hang around and take care of the men who eventually may get sick.

I have been reading most of the time.  I read “The Keys of the Kingdom” by Cronin twice.  I like it.  I like the clear and concise style.  However, I have not discovered any new thoughts.

Paul called me yesterday.  He wanted to go to play golf.  He told me he had just received a letter from Rose mailed October 5th from New York.   I have not received any news from you for the last eight days.  It is not long.  I can still wait a little longer without becoming anxious.  I have received the v-mail letters you sent me September 24th and 29th.  From now on, I am going to write the dates of the letters you send me.  In this way, you can check and know if any letter goes astray.  You should have a calendar where you write down the dates of all the letters you send me.  I am going to do the same.

Here life is running on in the usual way.  Nothing new to report or worthy of mention.  As you already know, I miss you always.  This feeling has become a part of me now.  I love you immensely.


								Always and forever yours,


								Silvio

									October 31, 1942

My darling wife,

I received today the v-mail letter that you wrote me on October 10th.  It was Saturday then as it is now.  I remained in camp that weekend and was not in the best of spirits.  I remembered very well that I was depressed, lonesome, and disgusted.  It was one of the low moments of my life.  My spirits have come up since.

In your letter you gave me a hint that my mother and father came to Lowell to visit you.  I am anxious to know when they came and when they left and what they did.  Am I a question box?  Did you go to New Rochelle by car or by train?  Or did they come directly to Lowell?  How did you find them?  Do they look older than they used to?  Did Dad complain of his leg?  I do wish that I could have been able to be home with you all.

No, darling, your v-mail letters are very clear.  I do not experience any difficulty in reading them.  Are you finding my letters illegible?  You know that I have good eyesight and can read small handwriting without any difficulty.

Do you know that I have not received a long letter of yours for a long time?  I do miss them.  I read that a few are on the way.  I hope that they will reach me soon.

Shortly, I am going to send you some money.  I will send $160.00.  Do not worry about me, darling.  I save it so that one day we can enjoy it together.  I do not enjoy myself when I am not with you.  I only spend a few dollars a month on things that I really need.   The rest I prefer to send to you to spend it together.

When you write, darling, do not follow my example.  I cannot write everything I want to.  But you can.  I wish that you will buy a Christmas gift from me to you.  I sent you a sapphire about a month ago.  Did you receive it? I hope you will get it before Christmas.  It would make a lovely gift.

Darling, I love you very, very much.  I adore you.



									All yours,

									Silvio

									November 9, 1942

My darling wife,

I have received the v-mail letters that you wrote me on October 12th, 16th, and 21st and the long letter you wrote me on September 28th.  I enjoyed them.  It was some time since I had received news from you and I started to worry.  Now I know that you are in good condition and ambitious to work and that my folks came to see you and were in Lowell for a couple of days.

I do not know what to advise you about your plan of going to Washington, D.C. to work for Uncle Sam.  Darling, I really do not know.  If you think that you like the work, why not?  I am afraid that you will lonesome without your mother.  How long do you have to wait for your position in Lowell?  Will you find a place to sleep and eat in the Capital?  You know that my sister had some trouble in finding a room.  Can you take your mother there?  Darling, I leave it up to your good judgment.  I know that you have good judgment and that you know what you want and what you should do.  I trust your good sense.

This morning, my sergeant who sleeps near me asked me, “Who is this lady by the name Annette?”   I asked him why.  He does not know your first name.  “Last night I heard you calling that name many times and telling her how much you love her.”   Did you ever hear me talking in my sleep?  I am sure that the sergeant does not know your name because I never mentioned it.  They know you as Mrs. Silvio Tontar.  How wonderful the dreams are!  They destroy time and space.  I dream of you very often and I can feel all day long afterwards the sweetness of your kisses.

Thank you, darling, for the good wishes for my birthday.  I do hope that next year we will be together to celebrate it.  I love you very much.  Adoring you always.


									I am all yours,

My darling and beloved Annette,

This is the first time since last June that I write you without using the typewriter.  It happens that the machine is out of use and needs a good spring cleaning.

How are you, darling?  I hope this letter finds you in the same healthy condition as I am as it leaves me.  I hope your cold is over and the first and last of this winter.

On November 11th, I received my birthday fruitcake that you sent me a long, long time ago.  It was excellent.  I have to congratulate you.  I was not only good but well preserved.  I made a meal out of it and shared it with my friends.  They all agree that it was very good.  

So far, I have received the letters you wrote me during the month of September and the v-mail letters you wrote in October.  Some of your long and lovely letters took more than two months to reach me!  

On November 12th, I sent you a cablegram of $160.00.  Have you received the gift I sent you in September?  The sapphire.  

I may as well start to wish you a Merry Christmas.  My darling, have all my love.  I adore you, my beloved wife.

									Merry Christmas!
									Happy New Year!

My darling Annette,

During the last two days, I have been with you, heard you, read your letters.  I received all the letters you sent me up to November 4, 1942.  I was a real holiday for me!  I received, in the meantime, the package you sent me on September 16.  Thank you, darling.  I like the chocolate bars you sent me.  I am going to eat them when I’m hungry.  I was thrilled to see your picture.  In the last seven months, you have not lost any of the charm that I love so much.  I must agree with you, though, that you have put on some weight.  I guess you and I could balance the scale now.  I weigh 160 pounds.  

I am feeling fine.  I am getting a nice tan and improving my already good stroke at swimming.  I am in Australia.  I saw a great deal of it lately, though I am still in the same place.  I wish you were with me to enjoy the swimming among the breakers of the sea.

I adore you.


									Yours,


									Silvio

										November 28, 1942

My darling Annette,

I started to write you with the typewriter, but had to change to handwriting because it stopped working.  

Here we are, Saturday morning.  It is warm, a prelude of summer days to come.  Summer will be officially in on Monday, December 1.  I cannot help myself from remembering that a year ago, while in the Carolinas, I looked forward to Christmas and the two-week furlough.  You had invited me to visit you.  I was planning and re-planning my trip to Lowell to visit you.  I wish I were back to last year and able to live the same experiences all over again.

I have not received any news from you for the last few days.  I got enough Sunday.  Ten letters from you!  What a big celebration!

On November 12, I sent you a cablegram of $160.00.  Did you receive it?

I wish you a very Happy New Year.  I hope the New Year will be so good to have us meet again.  I am looking forward to the day when I’ll be able to hold you in my arms again.   

All my love.

										I adore you.

My darling Annette,

I have received this afternoon your telegram and the v-mail letter you wrote me on November 17.  I am glad that you have received the money I have saved for you and me to spend when I come back.  From your letter, I guess that you are all right.  

You are thinking about the reptiles that are in great number in this part of the world.  Believe me, with the exception of a couple of pythons, one alive and one dead, I have not seen any other reptiles in this part of Australia.  I do not know what happened to the lizards, but for the last three months I have not seen any of them.  I guess they are scared of the American soldiers.

How are you?  Do you remember the date?  Ten months ago today?  Do you know what I was thinking last night?  I was reliving what happened in your living room in May last year.  I remember that you asked me point blank, “Why did you come here?”   I did not answer what I meant to.  I said I came to Lowell.  I wanted to tell you that I came to Lowell to see the girl that I love.  I wondered last night if I had answered you what my heart meant, maybe we would have married many months before we did.  I am very happy I got married.  Your mail brightens my days in exile.  I do not know how hard it would be to live so far away and not receive any news from the girl one so dearly loves.

I have been kind of busy recently.  I have travelled a great deal and had some fun.  Darling, you should have been here.  What breakers!  It’s a great deal of fun to go through them, to swim through them.  I enjoyed myself.  You should see my skin.  I am as black as a Negro.  I got all my sun very gradually.  I never got a sunburn since the one I got on the ship while on my way to this continent.  I am a good swimmer.  My stroke is very good and it takes me for a long distance.  The other day, I challenged the chaplain to follow me.  He did, but only for a little while.  Some time ago I taught Pepe how to float.  He has learned to swim since he came to this land.  

While I am writing, I am acting Major and will be for a few more days.  Last week, I was Acting Captain.  I have a feeling that I like to feel important.  It is good to change the monotony of the day.

Today I have sent some money to Dad.  I know that he has not worked all summer.  I know that he does not need it, but I think that he will be pleased to see that his son has not forgotten him.  I know that it will make him and Mother very happy.

I talked to Paul.  I have not seen him for a long time.  I am going to have a golf match with him soon.  He thinks that he can beat me.  I am sure that I will teach him a good lesson.  I am starting to play golf satisfactorily.  Paul is looking for a sapphire to send to Rose.  I looked for it for a long time.  Finally, I found the one that I liked and bought it.

Darling, I am feeling the best of my life.  It is December, but feels like June.  The roses are in bloom, the air is perfumed, and the days are warm, but not excessively.  The nights are just made for me.  I can still sleep like a log.  All is quiet and peaceful around here.  

Sunday I went to town and (do not laugh) had steak and eggs for breakfast, for dinner, and for supper.  They have very good steak in this country.  They count their cattle by the millions, not by the tens or hundreds as we do.   I cannot complain about the food I am getting in camp.  It is very good and well cooked.  I am sorry you cannot eat any bananas or pick apples.  People have them here in their gardens as you have pears.

My beloved wife, until the next talk, I love you very much.



										All yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

I have received your package and what a surprise!  I was as thrilled as a child going through his Christmas stocking.  I was in my tent when the parcel was brought to me.  I was waiting for it, but I was not ready to receive such a surprise.  I opened it.  How did you know that I needed a toothbrush badly?  How did you know that I like that kind of candy?  Do you know that we had a party?  A few officers were present and we all enjoyed the candy that you sent me.

As I opened the parcel that contained your picture, I was puzzled as to what it might contain.  I was expecting your picture for a long time.  I thought that you would send me the picture alone.  I cannot tell you how pleased I was to see you again.  It is a beautiful picture.  The frame, the size, the coloring, the pose, everything is exactly as I wanted it to be.  Since yesterday, your picture has been in my tent.  I bid you good night last night and good morning when I got up this morning.  Oh, how I wish I were home!

How are you, darling?  How is everybody at home?  I received your telegram and v-mail of November 25.  

I am feeling very well.  I’ve had an easy time lately.  I went swimming, fishing and horseback riding.  It is a lovely horse.  It is as nice as it was in Shelton, but you are not with me and that makes a big difference.  

Darling, I wish you a Happy New Year.  Millions of kisses.


										I am all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Eight months ago I was sailing from a port that I did not want to leave through an ocean that I did not want to cross to a land that I did not want to see.  I knew that you would be looking for my ship from somewhere along the coast.  Eight months have passed.  How many more will pass before I will be able to see the port on my way to see the lady that I love?  Yes, it is eight months since I kissed you.  Such a long time.  I wish I were able to leave and come home to you.  As the time passes, I do miss you more and more and I yearn to be with you forever.

Yes, darling, I love you not only as much as I did before but much more.  I cannot love anybody else.  Nobody else can make me happy but my darling wife.  There is no better lady in the whole world than my dear and darling wife.

I am so glad that you sent me your picture that you cannot imagine it.  It is on my desk.  It is facing me all night.  I can see you in the dark.  I do not know how many times every day I look at you and talk to you.  I bid you Good Morning and Good Night as if you were present here.

A few more days and it will be Christmas, 1942.  I will be with you all day, my beloved wife, and also during the first of the year and all the days that will follow.

I sent you a telegram for the holidays.  I received your letter of November 28.

I am glad that you have found a job in your town.  I would like to know how you like it.  I’m sure that you are taking good care of our bank book.  To tell you the truth, I never had any doubts about it.

I love you. 							 Always and forever yours,


								Silvio

My darling and beloved wife,

It is Christmas morning.  It is our first Christmas.  And we are so far away.  I would give anything to be with you this day of all days.  I hope that you have received the cablegram that I sent you more than a week ago.  It does not look like Christmas here.  It’s too hot.  There are no lights, no Christmas trees, no singing of Christmas carols, no cold wind, no snow on the ground or in the air.  There is none of what we mean by Christmas.  I know that you would not like it here.  Here I am writing in the office.  The windows are all opened, a soft breeze is blowing, but not enough to make me comfortable.  

Last night I went to midnight mass for the first time in many years.  I wished that next Christmas we will be able to go together.

Are you going to eat a big dinner today?  Will you have turkey as usual?  Will Uncle come to dinner as usual?

I am going out to dinner.  I will have it with an Australian doctor.  He invited me to his own house.  I hope I will have a good dinner.  I feel hungry.  It’s nearly noon.

I have met many nice people in this town.  They do their best to make our men feel at home.  Most of the men are going out to dinner in different homes.  The priest and ministers came to our place and asked for the names of the men who want to go out to dinner.  

Darling, I wish you a Happy New Year.  I do hope that many months of it I will pass with you.  

As usual, I am always and forever yours,


										Silvio

My darling Annette,

It is twelve o’clock here.  In Lowell it is nine o’clock Christmas night.   How did you enjoy your holiday?  Have you had a good meal?  I have been thinking about you all morning, trying to imagine what you are doing at different hours.  I saw you in my mind going to church in the early morning.  I saw you coming back home and getting ready to prepare dinner.  I know that your mother helped you.  I bet you cooked a very good dinner.

Yesterday, I had a very good day.  I worked as usual until noon.  Then I drove to the residence of the Director of the local Australian hospital.  I had dinner with him, his wife, and their twelve year old daughter.  I played ping pong with the girl after the meal.  I played, yes, but my mind was in Fort Lewis where one Sunday you and I played together.  I had a regular American Christmas dinner and enjoyed it very much.  If you were present, it would have been ideal.  I had turkey with all the trimmings.  I had some time to sleep.  You know that here it is like July at home.  Then I was driven to another doctor’s house and had a very good supper.  I ate so much that I did not eat any breakfast this morning.  As a final touch to the day, I passed the evening listening to the American broadcast on the shortwave radio.  It was the Christmas eve broadcast from San Francisco, California.  You can imagine what was going through my mind while I was listening.

Oh, darling, I wish I were with you.  I adore you always and forever.


										I am yours,


										Silvio

My darling and beloved Annette,

Here I am back in the same place where I wrote you most of my letters during the last five months.  

Yesterday, it was a grand day for me.  I received twelve letters and four packages.  I got Uncle’s package with a shoe shining kit that I badly needed and a belt which I am wearing already.  Mine was worn and old.  I received your mother’s package, yours, and one from a club I belonged to in Port Chester.  I received your telegram and thank you.  Did you receive mine?  I read the letters you sent me on October 27, November 14, December 7, and December 12.  I have the air mail stamps and I am going to use them.  I have the two v-mail letters of December 2 and 7.

Darling, I cannot answer some of the questions you ask me.  I’ll tell you all about it when I come home.  We will have so much to talk about that we will not sleep for days and days.  Yes, I have received your birthday telegram and in good time.  Last month, I got my birthday cake.  I ate some of it.  The other part is still in my tent.  I have been moving so much during the last two months that I did not have time to eat all of my birthday cake.

I do not have anything to ask of you.  I now have everything that I need.  The Christmas gifts you sent me were made to order.  I am receiving the Reader’s Digest regularly.  I am glad you received the snapshot I sent you.  I was wondering if it went through the censor.  I had a chance to use the golf balls you sent me.  Do they bounce! 

 I cannot talk about the weather, but here Christmas is equivalent to our Fourth of July.  The people rush to the beaches to cool off.  I wish I were home.  I am sure you would not get any colds. 

You ask me to scold.  How can I?  The only time I get sore is when I do not receive any mail from you and then I know that it is not your fault.  I was curious to know what kind of a job you have.  You certainly have changed in the last ten months.  We are on the same footing now.  When I come back, we’ll have to find something to argue about.  You know that life cannot be fully happy unless we have an argument once in a while.  I cannot tell you how I feel about your work.  I used to envy the husbands of the English and Russian ladies who left an easy life at home for a munitions job.  Darling, I am proud of you.  I am proud that my wife is a pioneer of the new civilization that is already dawning in the world.  You did not humble yourself, Darling.  You did elevate yourself above our times.  My admiration for you is boundless.  When I come back and victory is won, I’ll be able to say that WE won the war. 

If you do not want to use the car, my advice is to store it away.  You have the garage.  You can have a mechanic help you to store it.  No, darling, I do not mind if you work.  Let the people who do not have any brains talk.  Let the people who live in the past and not today talk their stupid nonsense.  It will never amount to anything.  

Dad sent me the results of the elections.  I expected it to come out in such a way.  

I have the v-mail stationery.  I have used it.  I received a letter from Dad and Mother.  They are very proud of their daughter-in-law.

Darling, I am sorry that you got a cold.  I wish I were with you when the wisdom tooth was pulled out.  I would have given you moral help. 

I had a very good Christmas dinner.  Tomorrow will end the year.  My wish and hope for the new year is to be able to see you and to be with you.  I am ready to pay any price and to stand any sacrifice and hardship to be able to come home to you, to kiss you, to hold you in my arms, to keep you warm when it’s cold, to love you deeply and forever.  There is no other woman in the whole world that can compare to my darling wife.  

I love you, Darling, immensely, more today than ever before.  Your picture is following me wherever I go.  I like it, Darling.

I wish you a Happy New Year with me!


									I am all yours, 


									Silvio
