										V-J Day

My darling Annette,

The day has come.  The war is officially over.  Now it will be a question of weeks before you and I will be together again.  There is no reason on earth why we should not be together.  I’m waiting daily for my orders to come home.  Today’s news says that 13,000 medical officers will be discharged from the Army within five months.  I am in the highest bracket.

Today, for the first time in years, you and I heard the same broadcast at the same time.  I heard President Truman talking from the White House.  I felt that you too were watching.  Is it true?

The time has come when I am completely absorbed by my coming back home.  I forget my surroundings and am swayed by my dreams into the days to come, when I’ll have you in my arms.

I’m receiving your mail regularly.  Your letters are lovely.  They keep my morale floating in the clouds.  Yes, your letters are lovely, darling.

I’m getting along as usual.  My life is easy.  I’m only doing medical work.  I take care of a ward full of patients.  It’s the same work I’ve been doing for a long time.  But it’s interesting.

I love you with all my heart.

										I am all yours,


										Silvio

										September 4, 1945

My darling Annette,

It’s a dreary day.  It rains slowly, drop by drop, monotonously.  Everything is wet except my tent with a wooden floor.  I’d hate to be in a foxhole during a day like this.  The weather has not interrupted my routine work.  

Here there was an interruption of eight hours.  While I was writing in the last period, the eight o’clock news started to be broadcast.

I take care of my patients.  I don’t have any wounded ones.  I haven’t had any combat for more than three months.  The majority of the men who are sick are suffering from common ailments usually found in the States.  

Life is easy nowadays, especially for me.  I shouldn’t complain if it wasn’t for the fact, and this is the main one, that I am separated from you.  Everything is very quiet around here.  There is nothing moving, not even a rumor about when I’ll move out of here and start my trip on my way home.  Anyway, whenever I leave from here, I’ll be coming toward home.  This time, I’ll definitely come toward home and you.  The news from the radio is good.  The conquest of Japan is proceeding according to my heart’s desire.

I’m starting to think and plan as to what to do when I’m discharged from the Army.  I already told you that I’d like to work in a civilian hospital for a while and refresh my mind.  I don’t think I’d stay long, a few months.  Would you like to inquire at St. Joseph’s Hospital as to my chances to work there for a while?  I don’t think it’s necessary to plan yet about opening my office.  I want to go back to Port Chester, but before making any decisions, I want to survey the field.  

I’m not afraid of the future.  I’ve faced death and any tribulation that a man can stand, so nothing will scare me or cower me.  I know that I can make a good living in private practice.  I succeeded when I had all the odds against me.  I’ll make a better go this time when I have you by my side to help me.

However, before starting to do any work, I want to have some time with nothing else to do but to be with you, free from any engagements, free from any duty or responsibility.  I’ll have only one mission, one purpose: to make you happy.

I’ve been writing you regularly every two or three days.  I guess your delayed mail was due to the sudden end of the war.  I hope that you’ve received my mail by now.  Don’t worry now, darling.  There is no danger here, nor any nurses.  I haven’t seen one for ages.  But, if they were here, I love you so much and am so eager to be with you that they would not get my attention.

I have one desire, one hope, one yearning, one love and that’s you!                   Silvio

My darling Annette,

I’m displeased, though not surprised, that you have not received any mail from me for ten days.  As usual, and more than usual, I have written to you regularly, three or four times a week, sometimes even every day.  It all depends on my mood.  If I am happy, I write you daily.  If I’m blue, I don’t like to write.  It’s dangerous when the mail is censored to write what I think about the way medical officers are treated and how long they are kept overseas.  In that case, silence is golden.  It is still forbidden to talk or write about movements of troops.  But, I guess the delayed mail was caused by a shortage of planes used for other purposes.  By now, I hope you have received my mail and are happy that your husband still loves you as much and more than he ever did.

Have you enjoyed your trip to the White Mountains?  Have you had a good time?  Why all the mystery?  Why all the periods interrupted by dotted lines?  You don’t have to try to make me jealous because I am.

I’ll be home soon and we will have a good time together.  Don’t you think so?  How long I have to wait I don’t know.  Why so much delay, I don’t know.  I wish they would stir up.

I guess the mail will be irregular from now on.  Some days you’ll get it in a bundle, some other days you will not receive any.  Now that the war is over, there is no danger of submarines or Jap planes.  I know I’ll be home soon.  It will be a matter of weeks at most.

By the way, do not send me any Christmas packages.  I definitely expect to be home by this coming Christmas and long before Christmas.  I don’t know how long I’ll remain here.  By the time you receive this letter, I may be on my way toward home.  I expect to move soon.  I can’t tell you where I’ll go, but I’ll be nearer to you than ever before.

I now have 115 points and only 85 are needed to be discharged from the Army.  I expect to be on my way home as soon as this confusion is settled.  It’s as hard, though more pleasant, to change from war to peace as it is from peace to war.

Today, our Army is in Tokyo.  This is the last touch to victory.

Don’t worry, darling.  Wait for me.  I’m coming home.

											I love you.

									Zamboanga
									September 10, 1945

My darling Annette,

The word “Zamboanga” that you find written at the right top corner of my letters means disappointment.  Every time you open my letters, that word tells you that I’m still in the same place and what is more important, that I have not moved toward home.  But, don’t bother.  You won’t see it much longer, in a few more letters at the most.  

I’m on the move again.  Today, I discharged all my patients.  I sent most of them back to duty and a few to another hospital.  Now, I’m getting ready to move somewhere.  This is the first move I have made in peace time since 1941.  I know where I’m going, but don’t know why.  I can’t tell you yet.  Anyway, it will be hundreds of miles nearer to you.  

This is the first time that I start a trip toward home.  It’s the first step, the others will follow.  I expect to leave within ten days.  I warn you, if you do not receive my mail regularly from now on, it will be caused by my next move.  I’ll let you know the moment I land or as soon as I can mail a letter.  I expect to be on my way home in the near future.  It will only be a question of a short time.  They are getting the ships ready and the War Department has committed itself by announcing that 15,000 medical men will be discharged within a few months.  Moreover, the point system is going into effect as far as the officers are concerned.

Everything now indicates that I will soon be on my way home.  Don’t think that I’m slighted or left behind.  No medical man has gone home from our Division since the war in Europe ended.  They were short of medical men in this theatre.

There was a lapse of many hours.  I’m packing.

The paper butterfly you sent me from Laconia, New Hampshire scared me.  It took me a few seconds before I knew what was going on.  There are all kinds of insects around.  Some of them are always bothering me.  I thought that it was another pest and instinctively was trying to get rid of it.  You can imagine what a laugh I got when I found it to be a paper butterfly.

You are not the only one complaining that you are not receiving any mail.  This seems to be a common complaint from wives all through the States during this last month.  I guess that the mail is forwarded by boat instead of air.  I hope by now that you have received my news.  I’m still waiting and cursing for the delay that is stupid and unnecessary.  

I include two negatives.  They were taken a few nights ago while I was reading a book about Taoism.

I love you very much.				I’m all yours,                         Silvio

									September 14, 1945

My darling Annette,

Your mail is also getting slow.  Yesterday, I received your letter of August 26.  I’m sure it came by boat.  So I’m sure that my mail reached you by boat.  This explains the long-delayed mail and the silence of more than ten days.  Everything is in turmoil now and a lot of confusion is bound to be present.

I don’t have any work now except packing and getting ready to move out of here.  I don’t know when I’ll leave.  It will be soon.  I can’t tell you where I’m going.  I’m certain, however, that you’ll know it a few hours after I land.  I figure that I’ll make this trip, establish myself where I go for a short time, await transportation, and come home.  In any circumstance, I should be home within a few weeks.  I expect to be home next month.  

My name is on the list.  It has been there for four months and it’s bound to be picked any time after this move.  I consider this trip the first leg of my voyage home.  The second one will take me to San Francisco, the third to the East coast and you.

Lately, the days have gone by quite fast.  I’ve seen a movie nearly every night.  Some were good, some mediocre.  They were all comedies with a lot of laughs.

I’m back to my reading and playing cribbage.  I have won and lost.  Some days I cannot win a game, however long I play.  The cards are against me.  Some other days, I win every game and nobody can beat me.

I am doing some heavy reading.  Now I’m reading Will Durant’s “The Story of Philosophy.”  I kept my eye opened to its pages for nearly eight hours yesterday.  I found the book very stimulating.  It’s like talking or listening to the great minds of all times: Spinoza, Voltaire, William James, John Dewey and many others.  I was surprised at Voltaire.  He disappointed me.  I did not find him as fascinating or as great a genius as he appeared to my college mind many years ago.  His halo of greatness as a thinker is giving way, is fading.  I don’t think he is a great thinker, nor an original one.  However, I admire his honesty, courage, wit and genius as a writer and his keen analysis of the society of his day.

It’s raining.  It’s comfortable and cool and pleasant to dream.  I have glorious daydreams.  The time is getting nearer to their realization.  I’ll have you in my arms very soon and no power on earth will ever separate me from you.

I love you with all my heart.

											I’m yours,

									Zamboanga
									September 18, 1945

My darling Annette,

This is my last letter from Zamboanga.  Tomorrow, I’ll move out and board a ship ready to sail for Japanese waters.  By now, you probably know already that the Division is going to land at Kure, a couple of dozen miles from Hiroshima where the first atomic bomb was dropped.  I expect to move there, settle down, and wait to come home.  I thought I was going to come home any day.  I was hopeful up until yesterday morning.  I’m on the top list of the officers selected to be sent home.  The War Department has already ordered the Army to send the “old men” home.  I expect to receive my orders a few days after I land.  I’m sorry for you, darling, who has to wait so long.  But, it will not be long now.

I’m glad you received notice from San Francisco regarding the box of clothing I sent you 18 months ago.  It’s about time.  Yes, darling, open it.  It’s addressed to you.  I wonder in what kind of shape my uniforms are!  For the time being, I’m attached to the Artillery.  My address is 205 F.A. A.P.O. 41 c/o P.M. San Francisco, California.

Yes, darling, we will have many weeks to ourselves.  We will plan it when I come home.  I’d like to specialize in obstetrics, delivering babies, you know.  I’ll see what opportunities will be afforded to me.  I expect to go back to general practice and make a living.  I know that I’ll succeed in earning a good living.  I don’t think you’ll be working for very long.  

I’m going to be home and a civilian within a very short time and forget everything about the Army.  I think that I’ve given all and not received much.  

You aren’t going to receive any mail for a while.  I’ll see if I can send you a telegram as soon as I reach Japan.  Don’t worry, darling.  Everything will turn out all right.

I love you with all my heart.

											I’m all yours,

									Leyte Gulf
									September 21, 1945

My darling Annette,

I came aboard this ship on September 18, only a few hours after I wrote you my previous letter.  The following day, I left for Leyte where I am now.  The ship is anchored for I don’t know how long.  Do you know that I was here eight months ago?  I feel mighty good to know that the whole Philippine campaign is behind me.  I consider this trip my first step on my way home.  I’ll not be long in Japan proper, probably only a few days.

It’s a great pleasure to travel on a ship in peace time.  I don’t have to attend any drills, don’t have to carry a life saver around my neck all the time, and don’t have to worry about being torpedoed.  There is none of the tension so common in war time.  The food is good and the company is congenial.  I only have one hundred men to attend to.  I’m busy an average of five minutes a day.  All the rest I dedicate to reading, sleeping, eating, and dreaming of you and of all the good times we will have together.  

From how everything stands now, I expect to be home by the end of October or the beginning of November.  There will be no chance to go out in the gloomy country or to the seashore.  Anyway, I don’t regret it.  I’ve seen so much sea and lived so long in the country among brooks and green trees that I’ll welcome the chance to pass my vacation in a big city.

I’m going to try to take one of those refresher courses given to the medical officers.  I don’t intend to specialize for the time being.  It will take too long.  I don’t intend to stay two or more years in a hospital in order to specialize in any field.  I’ll see how things stand when I get home.

You have to be patient with the mail service in the near future.  I’ll be at sea for nearly ten days.  I’ll write you again at the beginning of October from Japan.

Tomorrow, I start my forty-second and last month overseas.  I don’t know how I stood it so long away from you.  It will not be long now.  I’ll have you in my arms very shortly and for keeps.

I love you darling with all my heart and soul.

										I’m yours,

									At Sea
									September 22, 1945

My darling Annette,

This morning, I left Leyte Gulf.  It was a quiet morning.  The sea was glassy and smooth, the air cool, the mountains clear and green.  I sailed nearly all day through green, hilly islands.  I have spent most of the days reading anthropology.  I just witnessed a prosaic sundown.  The sea is calm.  An occasional swell makes the ship roll.  I’m not feeling seasick yet.  Today, I start my forty-second month of overseas duty.  I’m coming home this month, not September, but during this forty-second month.  I’m dreaming of happy days with you.

									I love you.

									September 24, 1945

I intended to write you a few words last night, but I couldn’t make it.  The sea was a little bit rough, the boat was rocking and rolling, and my stomach was not feeling right.  I hit the sack, as the sailors say, and slept until early this morning.  Last night, there was a beautiful sky with a large moon.  Everything was inviting to dream and love, but I could not dream, nor feel the beauty of the evening.  My stomach was not feeling well and I had to hit the sack.  

I must wait another week before I’ll receive any news from you.  Tomorrow noon, I expect to be at Okinawa.  

It’s a beautiful day with a lovely though warm breeze and a sun full of force in a bright and cloudless sky.  The ship is gliding forward on the smooth water.  Every knot, every mile, every hour is bringing me nearer and nearer to you.

									I love you.

									Evening

I’m not seasick tonight.  The sea is so calm, so smooth that I don’t feel any motion whatsoever.  I like it this way.  I gazed at another sundown.  It was beautiful.  I compared this sundown with the ones I saw forty-one months ago.  Then I was going away from you, now I’m coming toward you.

I wish you were with me!  It’s a pleasure to travel in a calm, peaceful sea.  All the lights are on.  The port holes are wide open all night long and the nights are cool.  I sleep like a log.  I’ve been eating good food.  The Navy takes good care of its nephews.  I have a very congenial group of officers on board.  I have only known them for eight days and it appears as if I have known them all my life.  They are friendly.  

I’m doing a deal of reading.  I’m reading medical books now.  I’m getting ready for my civilian life.

									I love you.

Late this afternoon, I approached Okinawa.  It was dark by the time the ship dropped anchor.  I’m now a few hundred yards off the coast of the island that saw one of the most bitter fights of this war.  You should see it now.  It’s all illuminated.  The whole coast line is full of lights.  Nobody would dream that only a few months ago, men were killing each other here.  The harbor is full of ships of all sizes.  I have never seen so many ships in one single harbor.  

Today, it has rained.  The sea has remained calm.  Tonight, it’s cooler.  The temperature has dropped from 85 degrees to 78 degrees and I feel the difference.  It’s more comfortable.  

I’m eating good food.  This trip has been a good vacation so far.  If I only had you with me, I could not ask for anything better.

									I love you.

Another day has gone by.  I’ve been sitting and looking at the Okinawa coast and wondering that only a few months ago, a few hundred yards from me, men were fighting and in the same sky, just above my head, suicide planes were flying, causing death and terror.

It’s all quiet now.  The weather is springlike.  Now it rains and a few minutes later, it’s all sunshine.  I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky this morning.  It was glorious.  I have passed most of the day reading or dreaming about my coming home to you and what we will do.  I want to do one thing: to love you.

The sun has set behind Okinawa’s hills.  I’m still at Buckner Bay waiting to move to Japan.  I’ll be waiting for some time.  I wish they would hurry!  The sooner I reach Japan and get established, the sooner I’ll leave for home and your kisses.

This morning, I took a ride in a Navy motorboat.  The Executive Officer of this ship was from New Rochelle, so I was granted permission to move around.  I never saw so many ships in all my life.  Ships of all sizes, small ships, big ships, large and lean ships.  I stepped ashore and took a walk on Okinawa soil.  As far as I am concerned, the Japs could have kept it.  There is too much mud.  I’ve seen enough mud and I don’t want any of it anymore.  When I came back, the officers asked me how I liked the island.  I told them that it was fair, but that General Stilwell, who commands the island’s troops, did not treat me well.  He gave me a muddy reception.  Witty, eh?  

I want to mail this letter tomorrow morning.  Have all my love and many kisses.  I’ll be with you soon.

I love you.

									I’m all yours,

									September 28, 1945

My darling Annette,

A couple of hours ago, I left Buckner Bay, not for Japan, but for the open sea.  At noon, we were warned of the approaching of a typhoon from the south.  We left the Bay because (listen to this) it is safer for the ship to be in the open sea during a typhoon.  Now, the sea is calm and smooth like glass.  There is no breeze.  It’s hot.  The sky was cloudless all day, but now is cloudy.  There is a lot of talk aboard the ship and a lot of work.  The sailors are getting ready for the impending trial.  I’m curious to see what a typhoon looks like.  I’ll be terribly seasick!  I’m calm and not worried.

I’ve been studying anatomy all day.  I like anatomy.  It helps to refresh my memory.  I gave you a few lessons in elementary anatomy.  Do you remember?  Oh!  I wish I were back home and with you to love you with all my body.

newletter

									September 29, 1945

I have been waiting for the typhoon all day.  It’s approaching in our direction, slowly at a velocity or 40 to 60 knots an hour.  So far, the sea has been relatively calm.  There are big swells that make the ship rock.  I had my supper and am holding it down.  So far, I am taking it courageously.  I’ll let you know how I’ll be faring.  I am living in a state of apprehension, anxiety, and curiosity.  I am curious to see what a typhoon looks like even if it is going to cost me a lot of seasickness.  

My chair is getting restless.  I have a hard time to keep it calm.  It has a tendency to slide from one side of the room to the other.  I have to anchor myself to the desk to keep myself in a writing position. 

I wish we could get our orders and move to Kure.  I’m supposed to arrive there by October 3.  I expect to stay there a couple of weeks and then move along to the way home and you.

I have been reading all day.  I’m studying.  It keeps my mind occupied and makes the time go by fast.  But, it will never pass fast enough for me.  I want to come home and be with you.

									I love you.

									October 1, 1945

It was impossible for me to keep a date with you last night.  The day was fair and I felt well.  The ship was running away from the typhoon with success until nightfall.  Then, the swell reached us and I was not feeling well.  I did not vomit, but did not feel well and went to bed early.  

Now, I’m back at Buckner Bay at Okinawa.  I expected to be at Kure by now.  I’ve been cruising for the last few days around the island, trying to elude the typhoon coming up from the Philippines.  The ship was not hit and this afternoon came back.  

Tonight, I am well and cheerful.  I hope that this month will see me on my way home.  The Army is really putting an effort in trying to send a lot of men home.  I expect to be one of them within a few days from when I land on the sacred soil of Japan.  Meanwhile, have all my love.

My darling Annette,

I’m anxious to leave this Bay for good.  I’m anxious to move out of here and go to Japan.  It’s not Japan I want to see, but your mail.  I have not read one of your letters for 16 days.  The Navy officers are getting mail every day now.  It makes me suffer to see them reading their mail.  I don’t resent their receiving mail.  I only envy them and curse my bad luck.

The days are getting long.  I slackened a little bit in my study of anatomy.  My brain is getting tired or overburdened.  Do you know, darling, that I’m telling everybody that during this current month I’ll be coming home?  I really believe that I’m on my way home and will be in Japan just long enough to catch a boat for San Francisco.  I don’t say I hope it will be true.  I feel that it’s going to be true.

I don’t expect to be discharged from the Army right away.  I think that I’ll be discharged four months after I reach home.  In forty-five months of service, I had only seven days of leave.  All the leave that I was supposed to get every year, one month a year, has been accumulated.  I have at present 110 days of accumulated leave.  That will give me a good vacation to last nearly all winter.

I love you.

									On the Way to Japan
									October 3, 1945

Early this morning, we steamed out of Buckner Bay.  The ship in motion caused a breeze and this cooled the air in my cabin.  I slept comfortably until nine o’clock this morning.  

Today, I have not done a thing.  I have not read a line of my book of anatomy.  The sea has been slightly rough, not enough to make me sick, but only queasy.  I slept in the afternoon.  Now it’s about 8 P.M.  A movie is shown.  It’s a comedy picture and I don’t like it.  Moreover, the place where the movies are shown is a hot place.  I prefer the coolness of this place to a movie.  

I’m looking forward and dreaming of the day that will come soon when you and I will pass the evenings together, unconscious of time, past and future.  We will live.  I don’t regret to come home in the winter time.  I’ve seen enough land, trees, meadows, rivers and shores.  I’d like to live inside a house, buildings for a change.  I want you to be with me and be happy.

I love you.

This morning, I saw for the first time, the hills and mountains of Japan proper.  I saw the hills and mountains of the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku.  All day, I’ve seen only hills and mountains and mountains and hills.  Some of the hills are beautiful to look at.  They are all intensively cultivated.  So far, I sympathize with the Japs to fight their way our of this country!  Tomorrow, I’ll land on Kure.  I don’t know what part of the day.  

I’m staying in the middle of the Inland Sea for the night.  All the islands around are populated.  Believe me, tonight, I can’t see one flickering light coming from the land.  The Japs are welcoming us with silence and hate...

Today has been fair.  The wind blew strongly all day, but sailing between two islands, the ship did not roll or pitch.  The waves were too small to bother this ship.  Here, it’s cooler.  The temperature is typical New England fall weather.  It’s cool for me and I am wearing a field jacket for the first time in years.  It’s only 70 degrees!

I’m looking forward to landing because I think that soon I’ll be told and ordered to come home and to you.   I’m anxious to start to love you with all my body and soul, not only in my dreams but in reality.

										Japan
										October 11, 1945

My darling Annette,

Monday afternoon, I landed on Japanese soil.  I was out in the harbor for two days, waiting for the ship to be unloaded.  Gee, I never saw a place like this!  I don’t blame the Japs to try to fight their way out of here!  It has rained day and night ever since I landed with the exception of the last few hours.  I’m stationed in a barrack that was used by the Jap troops.  I don’t know why they put a roof on top of this barracks.  The one on top of my room does not hold any water.  It rains in my room nearly as much as it rains outside.  People blame it on a typhoon that hit this area about a month ago.

I’m located on the Island of Honshu, the main Japanese island, about 400 miles south of Tokyo.  I’m only twenty miles from the city of Hiroshima where the first atomic bomb was dropped.  I have not visited the place.  I was told that it’s a horrible sight of destruction.  

The town I live in called Hiro is a small one located in a valley and open to the harbor.  It’s surrounded by hills and mountains.  On top of the rain, there is cold weather.  It’s not really cold, but it’s not agreeable for me and I used two blankets and a poncho to keep myself comfortable in my sleep.  I’m counting the days that I have to pass here.

I saw and read the order that is supposed to send me home.  I said supposed because I don’t believe anybody until I’m out of this Division and on my way home.  My order may be out any day.  I expect to be out of here before the end of the month.  I’m looking forward with a feeling of certainty, however, to eat Thanksgiving dinner with you and to thank God with all my heart that I’m out of this jam.

The first day I landed, I did not see any Japs with the exception of policemen and a few men.  Today, women and children and everybody is out.  They appear friendly.  They salute and bow to every American soldier.  They don’t look warlike.  I have the impression that the population as a whole is peaceful and willing to cooperate.  I talked to a Jap who speaks English.  He told me that the people did not want war and that they were forced into it.

I have not received any mail from you since the middle of September.  I was told that I must wait for nearly another week before the mail will reach me.  Not even during the campaign was I so long without your mail!  I hope everything will be over soon and I’ll take that trip toward home and you that I have dreamed of for 42 months.

I love you with all my heart.

											I’m yours,

My darling Annette,

I’m getting settled down, I hope not for very long, in the land of the Japanese.  During the last two days, the weather has been cold, but dry.  I am wearing a big sweater and sleeping in my bedroll.  I’ve been carrying it with me for a long time and now, finally, I found that it’s worth its weight in gold.  It keeps me warm while the rest of the men shiver.

I don’t like Japan.  There is too much suffering, too much misery, too much struggling to live.  Yesterday, I saw what once was the city of Kure.  I only saw a vast mass of rubbish, of buried ruins with a wall or chimney standing here and there.  What a scene of desolation!  I have not seen Hiroshima yet.  I was told it’s much worse than Kure.

The people don’t seem to dislike us.  The kids wave and smile and salute while we ride by on the road.  Many are visiting our camp daily.  Some are working in our area.  They appear to be glad to work for us.  But they are ragged and all wear at least in part Army uniforms.

I’m expecting news every day.  If I don’t come home soon, I know who to blame.  There is one man who deserves all the blame.  You know his name and I hate his guts from the bottom of my heart.  We’ll talk about him when I come home.  I’ll hate the S.O.B. as long as I live because I know he is to blame for my staying overseas so long.  We are about two hundred officers who are in the same boat.  I sure hate him.

The lights went out.  I couldn’t finish my letter.  

I’m in good humor today.  There is a good rumor going around that I’ll be on my way home in a few days, before the end of the month.  I’m betting on Thanksgiving at home and with you.  A month from now, I’ll be home or racing toward home.  I’ve been waiting for so long that I hardly believe it myself.  

I love you, darling.  I love you with all my heart.  I’ll be with you soon.

I love you and am all yours.

My darling Annette,

Yesterday, I received your first letter since September 15, 1945.  It was written on September 1.  This mail service is as bad as it used to be during the first months of my overseas duty.

Your worry was legitimate.  Your intuition was right.  Then, you were afraid that I was going to be sent to Japan.  Right you were!  Here I am in Japan.  I hope not for very long.  I may be sent home any day now.  I’ll not be kept here in the Army of Occupation.  I’m coming home to you, my darling.  I’ll be leaving any day now.  I’m waiting and waiting.

Yesterday afternoon, I took a ride to Hiroshima, the city where the first atomic bomb was dropped, that is located 22 miles from here.  I never saw or dreamt of ever seeing such desolation, such a complete, thorough destruction of everything.  Can you imagine an area as large as the city of Lowell a mass of rubbish with a building standing here, a chimney a mile away, a wall another mile away?  I stood on top of a bridge and saw for miles and miles all around me masses of crumbled tiles.  Nothing remained that was alive, be it animal or vegetal.  Trees were burnt, houses were burnt and crushed.  The people who were living there on that August morning were all destroyed.  The power of the bomb was of such immensity that miles from where it exploded, I could see houses with no window panes and the structure of the buildings inclined or bent in the opposite direction of the center of the explosion.  Bridges were crushed, parapets were toppled over.  I drove through the ruins with a sinking heart, pitying the victims and being thankful that we used the bomb instead of them.  What a sight of utter destruction!

I love you very much.

										I’m all yours,

										Silvio

My darling Annette,

Your letter of October 8 reached me this afternoon.  I did not expect it.  It surprised and immensely pleased me.  Yes, darling, I feel as you do.  I am more determined and I’d like to have some sweet revenge.  I couldn’t make it for my birthday.  The day passed unnoticed.  I just started another year.  Nobody knew, nobody noticed it.

As you receive this letter, you may stop writing me.  I expect to be out of here within a few days.  I could not make it in October.  The ships you mentioned in your letter left Japan before I landed.  I did not land before October 8.  They left a few days before.

At the beginning of November, they’ll be another convoy.  THAT WILL BE MINE.  I will not send you a telegram from Japan because it will take longer than I’ll take by ship.  I’ll telephone you or telegraph you as soon as I land in San Francisco or as soon as it will be physically possible.  They have so many orders from the War Department that they will not be able to keep me overseas any longer.  That’s the only language they understand.  I’m looking forward to Thanksgiving Day with a feeling of certainty.  Nothing can stop me now.  I agree and feel as you do, darling.  I’ve been bitter for a long time.  But soon I’ll be home and all this will be forgotten.

This Japanese trip was not wanted, but now that I am here, I try to make the best of it.  I have gone around and visited native villages.  These Nips are poor.  I do not blame them for trying to expand.  You should see how they make use of every inch of their ground.  They transform their hills into gardens and their swamps into rice fields.  They work, men and women, day and night.  You should see the weight these tiny women carry!  The men are lazy and resentful.  They were haughty and reserved and hateful at the beginning of our landing.  Now, they are stunned by our efficiency and our mental, physical, and intellectual superiority.  They are developing an inferiority complex.  They are so far outmatched in everything that, instead of looking upon us as hated invaders, they look up to us with envy and a slight admiration.  These Japs have been treated royally.  They are more stunned than shocked.  I’ll be surprised if they will not be sorry to see us leave.  There are many who live upon our crumbs.

I told you that I have visited Hiroshima.  I could have lived without seeing it, but I don’t regret to have seen what a bomb can do.  Miles and miles of houses completely destroyed.  I rode through the ruins of Hiroshima for two hours and still left a great part of it unseen.  I’ll never forget as long as I live such a destruction.  I hope that it will remain as a warning to all mankind for all time.  I’ll tell you more when I come home.

I don’t know what I’ll do except that I’ll take a long vacation.  I have four months of leave to use.  We’ll take good care of it, n’est-ce pas?

I love you.  Have a lot of kisses.                            I’m yours,                       Silvio

My darling wife,

Five minutes ago, I have been officially informed that I am going home.  Yes, I have been told officially that I am coming home.  I’ll leave within a day or two.  I have to be in Nagoya by the 24th of October.  Darling, I have been waiting for this moment for 42 months.  Finally it has come!

Now, I officially inform you to stop writing.  I’ll be hearing your voice soon now.  I’ll start to pack and be ready for my coming trip home.

Now, I’ll start to say goodbye to the men that I’ll leave behind.  I’ve said goodbye to so many that left before me.  Finally, my time has come.

I’m so excited that I hardly know what to say.  Oh boy!  I’ll be with you shortly.

I love you, darling.

										I’m all yours,

My beloved wife,

Today I read the order that is sending me home.  I read the order that relieves me of the duty of Battalion Surgeon of this Battalion.  I’ll be on my way home within a day.  I’ll leave tomorrow afternoon for the port of Nagoya.  From there, I’ll sail to Seattle, then to home and you.  I’ve been waiting so long for this day.  Tomorrow that day will dawn.  I’ll take a train ride to the port of embarkation.  I expect to be in the States by the middle of November, home by the end.

I’m walking in the clouds.  I’ve been expecting and wishing for so long.  Finally, it came.  I’m ready and waiting.  I can’t do a thing now.  I’m only writing and chatting and willing to do nothing whatsoever.

Do you know, darling, that I’m receiving very little mail.  I know that everything is in confusion at the present time.  I’m lucky that I am coming home.  Otherwise, I would be in bad humor.  I’m in good humor.  I’ve been singing and smiling all day long.  I’m happy now because I feel that my dreams are coming true. I’ll have you in my arms within a few weeks and, darling, I will love you.  We’ll pick up our honeymoon where we left off.  We’ll be by ourselves, wherever our hearts desire.

It’s impossible for me to send you a telegram, darling.  I’ve inquired and found it is not possible.  I’ll telephone or telegraph when I land in Seattle.  I’m planning to go from Seattle to Fort Devens, Massachusetts where I’ll be released from the Army.  I don’t have any plans because I don’t know what kind of accommodations will be available.  I suppose they’ll have troop trains crossing the country.  I think I’ll be with you within a few days after my landing.  I’m thrilled just at the thought that a month from now, I’ll be able to kiss you and love you for twenty-four hours a day.  I’m starved for love.  Forty-three months overseas is too long for everybody and it’s more than too long for me.  Soon, it will be all over.

I got my winter clothing today.  I’ll don them tomorrow.  Do not expect any souvenirs from Japan because I’m not going to buy any.  I don’t want anything to do with the Nips.  I don’t want any memories from the Japs.  They, by now, are becoming very friendly.  They think that we are civilized, not so well as they are, but better than they had thought.  Can you beat that!

I’m enjoying in my dreams what I’ll enjoy shortly.  Meanwhile, have all my love.

I’m all yours and forever,


											Silvio
